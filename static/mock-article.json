    "text": "King initially beat a hasty retreat, insisting during a speech on the House floor that he was neither a white nationalist nor a white supremacist. \u201cI reject those labels and the evil ideology they define,\u201d he said.It was too late. This time, apparently, King had gone too far.Mitt Romney, the one-time party standard-bearer who is now a freshman GOP senator, called on him to resign. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell effectively agreed, suggesting he \u201cfind a new line of work.\u201d And on Monday evening, the newly minted House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy, directed his members to block King from continuing to serve on either the Judiciary or Agriculture Committees, where he had been one of the party\u2019s most senior members.With that move, McCarthy had done something that neither of the past two Republican speakers, John Boehner and Paul Ryan, had managed to do: taken substantive action to strip King of legislative authority.\u201cI am a brand-new leader,\u201d McCarthy explained on Tuesday when a reporter asked him why he had moved against King now and not before. \u201cI listened to what Steve said. I brought Steve in and met with him. I also did research on what Steve has said in the past. I believe this party is the party of Lincoln.\u201d\u201cThere is no room for white supremacy,\u201d McCarthy continued. \u201cThat\u2019s why I took a strong action.\u201dWhat McCarthy neglected to mention is that the political circumstances have also changed, both for Republicans as a party and for King personally. In the past, House GOP leaders like Boehner and Ryan have dispensed no more than rhetorical rebukes of King while allowing him to keep his perch on key committees and waiting for each successive controversy to fade with the churn of the news cycle. But with Democrats now in charge in the House, McCarthy could not stop Democrats from bringing a vote on resolutions either disapproving of King\u2019s comments or formally censuring him. The House on Tuesday afternoon voted, 424\u20131, on a resolution \u201crejecting white nationalism and white supremacy.\u201d King cast a yes vote on the measure, which cited but did not specifically condemn him. (The one \u201cno\u201d vote came from Democratic Representative Bobby Rush of Illinois, who was protesting the resolution\u2019s toothlessness.)\u201cIt was important for Republicans to stand up and say this is unacceptable, because if the Democrats had done that for them, that would have sent a terrible message to voters, not just in King\u2019s congressional district but voters throughout the country,\u201d says Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee who also served as a top aide to then\u2013House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.Yet what might have been an even bigger factor in McCarthy\u2019s decision was King\u2019s own suddenly precarious political standing back in Iowa. For more than a decade, King had been, well, a kingmaker in his home state: He regularly won reelection to the House by more than 20 points, and he was one of the most sought-after endorsements for conservative presidential contenders campaigning ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses. (In 2016, King\u2019s nod went to Senator Ted Cruz, though the congressman eventually became a close ally of Trump\u2019s.)",
