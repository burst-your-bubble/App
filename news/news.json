And experts say the likelihood of a recession is on the rise.\n\nBut key data on the state of the economy won\u2019t be released until legislation to fund federal agencies is passed.\n\nAbout a quarter of the government was closed in late December after lawmakers failed to reach a compromise on a funding bill with President Donald Trump, who has demanded $5 billion for his long-promised wall along the US's southern border.\n\nThe Department of Commerce, one of the nine cabinet-level departments shuttered, said it would not publish the closely watched economic figures it usually does during the shutdown, including the trade balance, gross domestic product, home sales, and personal income.\n\n\"Without that data, US businesses are flying blind,\" said Donald Moynihan, chair of the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. \"One of the historical strengths of the US economy is the ability to rely on high-quality data produced by the government. But right now US businesses are facing into a new year without data that their peers in other developed economies will have.\"\n\nThe longest shutdown on record comes at an already uncertain time in the US, where fading stimulus, trade tensions, and interest rates have raised expectations for slowing growth. In fact, the partial government closure itself has put large swaths of the economy in jeopardy.\n\nWith historic recession signals emerging, a lack of data could fan fears about a crisis. More than half of economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal forecast that a downturn could begin in 2020.\n\n\"Not getting the official economic data is likely to add even more fear to markets and consumers that are anxious about the possibility of recession in 2019,\" said Austan Goolsbee, a former economic advisor to President Barack Obama.\n\nOffering some relief to policymakers and businesses, official employment reports are still being released. Congress and the president passed legislation last year to fund about three quarters of the federal budget through September, including the Department of Labor.\n\nMoody's economist Adam Ozimek said that while missing out on other data would add to uncertainty, employment numbers are the most important for understanding where the economy is in the business cycle.\n\n\"So long as we can keep our eyes on inflation and the job market in the near term, the lack of information is unfortunate but not devastating,\" he said.\n\nStill, less obvious consequences for American businesses could outlast the shutdown, especially in the case of a prolonged impasse. The turmoil could make it more difficult for the government to maintain top staff at the Commerce Department, for instance.\n\n\"US businesses benefit from our government being able to recruit outstanding scientists because of the opportunities to work with great data,\" Moynihan said. \"But every shutdown creates enormous disruptions. I worry that the Trump era will make it harder to recruit and retain these scientists in the future.\"\n\nThe shutdown was in its fourth week and counting on Thursday, with no clear end in sight. But pressure appears to be mounting on Republicans, with most recent polls suggesting a majority of Americans blame the president and his party for the impasse more than they fault Democrats.\n\n\"Substantively, the lack of available economic data, while likely not a serious problem in the short run, would certainly become more serious as the days and weeks pass,\" said Jonathan Weiler, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"And I should add that if I don\u2019t think this will last long, it almost surely will.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nThe US and China are negotiating a trade war.

The USDA's Ch\u2026", "text": "With no sign of ending anytime soon, the government shutdown is starting to take its toll on federal services and workers. But for recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, also known as food stamps, there is some good news \u2014 for now.\n\nAccording to a plan released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), SNAP benefits will be available during the start of the shutdown as previously appropriated funding is carried over to meet the needs of the program.\n\nIn the initial USDA release about the shutdown, the department said SNAP benefits for January would be available but there was no commitment for February. In a later announcement, the USDA said that the department will send money for February's benefits to states that administer the program.\n\nBenefits for the month of February are being sent out this week, well ahead of the typical timing. Usually the funds would go out on or after February 1, but in order to ensure that the money is available the USDA told state agencies that administer the program that benefits had to be sent out by January 20.\n\nUSDA officials could not commit to providing SNAP benefits in March and it appears unlikely that the funds will be there if the shutdown were to run that long.\n\nGiven the fact that President Donald Trump threatened to shut the government down for \"months or even years\" during a meeting with congressional leaders on Friday, the uncertainty of SNAP benefits beyond February could become a problem for the millions of people who rely on the program.\n\nAnother problem has popped up with the SNAP benefits as well. Around 2,500 retailers are unable to renew their licenses to accept the SNAP payments, meaning customers in those stores can't use their Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, cards to purchase groceries.\n\nSarah Jackson, an employee at a store in Arkansas, told PBS that her store's license expired during the shutdown and the retailers did not make the cutoff to renew the license to accept SNAP benefits.\n\n\"Because of an argument about a wall, I have to look people in the eyes every day and tell them they can't pay for their food, for their children's food,\" Jackson said.\n\nThe U SDA said in a statement to the Chicago Tribune that only a small group of stores have lost their ability to accept SNAP benefits and the the stores themselves were responsible for the problem.\n\n\"There is a small percentage of stores that failed to complete a required reauthorization process that was due on December 21,\" the spokesperson said. \"Due to non-response, those stores were removed from the program, per standard procedure. These stores can take steps to update their status once FNS funding is restored and the necessary staff are in place to process the applications.\"\n\nFunding for the USDA's Child Nutrition Programs including \"School Lunch, School Breakfast, Child and Adult Care Feeding, Summer Food Service and Special Milk\" will also continue into mid-February, according to the USDA's plan, but it is also unclear what will happen after that point.\n\nRead more: Here's what happens to Social Security and disability benefits during a government shutdown\u00bb\n\nBut while SNAP and the Child Nutrition Program are safe for now, other food programs under the USDA's purview are not as lucky.\n\nOther non-SNAP domestic food programs are no longer receiving federal funding, but may be sustained through state and local funding. The programs that are no longer receiving USDA funds include the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, a program focusing on low income seniors; The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations.\n\n95% the staff at the office of Food and Nutrition Services\u2014 which oversees SNAP benefits and other food programs \u2014 is now on furlough and no longer receiving pay.\n\nRead more: The effects of the shutdown are only going to get exponentially worse as the fight drags on\u00bb\n\nIn addition to the food programs, other essential USDA duties including the inspection of eggs, dairy, and other food products will continue. Those services deemed non-essential, such as research or the staffing of some national forests, are discontinued.\n\nThe shutdown is now in its 29th day and there is no clear end in sight.", "stance": "L", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/government-shutdown-are-food-stamps-snap-wic-benefits-paid-2019-1", "imageUrl": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c2cfefbbd77302d5979d4a7-1920-960.jpg", "datePublished": "2019-01-02T18:25:57Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Yemen Press Reader 495: | Jemenkrieg-Mosaik 495 - Yemen War Mosaic 495", "author": "Dietrich Klose", "source": "Freitag.de", "summary": "26.

But they still need President Trump to sign off.", "text": "House Democrats will use their newfound power to try to reopen the government on Thursday. But they still need President Trump to sign off.\n\nDemocrats have a plan to end the partial shutdown on Thursday \u2013 the first day that they take control of the House of Representatives. And if it fails, they want to make sure everyone knows it\u2019s on President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Speaker-Designate Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that on Thursday, the House would vote on a series of measures that would reopen the government. There are seven outstanding appropriations bills: the series of measures the House Democrats are proposing would fund six for a year, and extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8. The bills have all passed Senate committees on a bipartisan basis.\n\nThey would vote separately on the funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which has been the sticking point that produced the shutdown. That bill would fund Homeland Security through Feb. 8 at current levels, which does not include money for a border wall. This latter part is similar to what the Senate passed unanimously earlier in December, before the House rejected it to fund Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\n\u201cWhile President Trump drags the nation into Week Two of the Trump Shutdown and sits in the White House and tweets, without offering any plan that can pass both chambers of Congress, Democrats are taking action to lead our country out of this mess,\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement. \u201cThis legislation reopens government services, ensures workers get the paychecks they\u2019ve earned and restores certainty to the lives of the American people.\u201d\n\nThe plan is unlikely to go anywhere unless Trump concedes he will not get his border wall imminently. With this measure, Democrats are explicitly trying to ensuring that the buck for the government shutdown stops with Trump and Senate Republicans.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t that hard: All Senate Republicans have to do is pass legislation they have already supported on a bipartisan basis,\u201d said one House Democratic aide. \u201cThey can either vote for their own bills and reopen the government or block them and continue the shutdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans refuse to support the first bill, then they are complicit with President Trump in continuing the Trump shutdown and in holding the health and safety of the American people and workers\u2019 paychecks hostage over the wall,\u201d Schumer and Pelosi said in their statement. \u201cIt would be the height of irresponsibility and political cynicism for Senate Republicans to now reject the same legislation they have already supported.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s office could not provide any predictions about how the Senate would proceed on the legislation, but said that the Senate would not deliver anything to the President that he would not sign. If the President continues to insist on $5 billion for the wall, the House Democrats\u2019 plan would fall into that category.The government has been partially shut down since midnight on Dec. 22, with the government locked in a standoff over Trump\u2019s wall demand. He says he will reject any spending package that lacks it, but the Senate Republicans do not have the votes to deliver that legislation to him. They need 60 votes to accomplish that objective, which would require some Democratic support.\n\n\u201cOur negotiations are at an impasse at the moment. I wish it were not so,\u201d Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, who chairs the Appropriations Committee that is responsible for the funding, said on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to move away from the blame game.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are clearly not heeding Shelby\u2019s advice. By moving to re-open the government on their terms, they are instead trying to ensure the blame stayed on Trump.\n\nThe bills the Democrats will propose are expected to pass the House easily, given that Democrats will have a majority of 40 seats. But in order for the government to re-open, they will also need to pass both the Republican-controlled White House and Senate.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. However, on Monday morning Trump tweeted repeatedly about the wall. Including saying: \u201cDemocrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013.

But Hill sources and people close to the president expect -- and, frankly, hope -- the president will announce he is trading immigration policies Democrats and some Republicans have longed for -- think DACA, temporary protective status for refugees -- for a border security package. The White House has said publicly for a while that it wants to find a way to restart negotiations with Democrats.\n\n-- IF THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY goes this route -- and, again, many Dems and Republicans truly hope he does -- it could be a big move, and may go some distance to breaking the nearly month-long gridlock of this shutdown. We saw VP MIKE PENCE and senior White House aide Jared Kushner in the Capitol this week, huddling with SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL. Pence and Kushner have been captaining this play. But Republicans want Trump to lead publicly here.\n\n-- THE UNDER-THE-DOME POLITICS: To the extent there are any good moves on DAY 29 of a shutdown, this would be it. This could put pressure on Democrats to come to the table and talk. Fixing issues like DACA and TPS are big-time policy wins for Democrats and many Republicans. The question we have is what could they offer Republicans on a border security package?\n\n--- HILL INSIDERS TELL US that the two sides are not talking about a stopgap bill to open government up during these negotiations. That could be a hurdle for Democrats, who have refused to talk while government is closed. Democrats have also said they\u2019re open to broader border security improvements, but not a wall.\n\n-- BUT \u2026 Even Democrats privately say that if the White House actually moves on policy it could put pressure on them to do something.\n\nDETAILS MATTER on immigration. If the president went this route, will he propose permanent policy, or temporary policy? How much money does he want? Is he going to move on the border security package? Will this be a wall, or something more palatable for Democrats?\n\nCOMBINE IT WITH THIS \u2026 JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS points out in the NYT today, Democrats have added $1 billion for border security into a spending bill they plan to pass next week.

He went to Dover Air Force Base this morning to greet the remains of four Americans killed in Syria.\n\nLUCKY US \u2026 DAVID ROGERS: \u201cWhen Congress debated border security without having a total meltdown\u201d: \u201cYes, it seems a distant memory amid all the heated rhetoric over the government shutdown. But it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Democrats and Republicans could have a reasoned debate over funding border security.\n\n\u201cIndeed, to go back now and track the history of appropriations bills sheds new light on a battle that today seems divorced from reality and lacking proportion.\n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump bashes Democrats daily for obstructing his border wall. But the record shows that he received much of his request in 2018 and had already won bipartisan Senate support for $1.6 billion in 2019 when he effectively blew up the process by greatly escalating his demands going into the fall midterm elections.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Democrats appear so repelled by the harsh symbolism of Trump\u2019s wall that they find it hard to talk about their record of helping another Republican president \u2014 George W. Bush \u2014 build many of the barriers that already exist along the border.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPOLITICO TICK TOCK \u2026 ANDREW RESTUCCIA and NANCY COOK: \u201c\u2018Theater of the absurd\u2019: How the shutdown\u2019s bleakest week unfolded for Trump\u201d: \u201cPresident Donald Trump met with a group of House lawmakers on Wednesday to talk about ending the month-long government shutdown. But he was more focused on the two people who weren\u2019t in the room: Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer.\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to come to a deal\u2019 without them, Trump told the mostly junior lawmakers gathered in the White House Situation Room. By then it had already been more than a week since the president had spoken with Pelosi, the House speaker, and Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. But Trump said he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. \u2018I\u2019ll wait them out,\u2019 he confided, according to a person present for the remarks. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe White House argued it canceled the trip to ensure that Pelosi and other top Democrats remained in Washington to negotiate a deal to end the shutdown. But the move doesn\u2019t appear to have kept Pelosi in town. She was spotted boarding a plane to San Francisco on Friday afternoon, according to a person who saw her.\u201d POLITICO\n\nTHE IMPACT \u2013 \u201cFederal Employees Turn to Pawnshops Amid Shutdown\u2019s Financial Pinch,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Mihir Zaveri: \u201cTelevisions.

He had previously said he would be \"proud\" to close down the government in the wall fight.\n\nHe offered a three-year reprieve from deportation to undocumented migrants brought to the US as children who are covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to people from certain nations who qualify for Temporary Protected Status.\n\n\"This is a common-sense compromise both parties should embrace,\" Trump said, apparently seeking to portray himself as a deal maker taking the initiative to end a record-long shutdown now in its 29th day that has left 800,000 federal workers without a paycheck.\n\nHe also appeared to offer a concession on the characteristics of his border wall -- one of his most iconic political goals. He described the wall as a \"strategic deployment of physical barriers or a wall. This is not a 2000-mile concrete structure from sea to shining sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations.\"\n\nBut the President also sprinkled his speech with his hardline immigration rhetoric and made questionable claims about how the wall would transform the fight against drugs trafficking and violent crime in America. Such language is unlikely to entice Democrats into the compromise Trump said he was seeking.\n\n\"The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President notably did not mention the plight of federal workers going without paychecks, some of whom fear they may not be able to make mortgage, rent or car payments, or are relying on food banks.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not even wait for the speech to reject the proposal. She said it was a \"a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.\"\n\n\"It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the President's offer was not really an offer at all.\n\n\"It was the President who singled-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place -- offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nThough it was quickly rejected by Democrats, Trump's proposal could move the politics of the shutdown to a new stage, as various bills to reopen the government and fund the wall are debated on Capitol Hill, after weeks of fruitless negotiations between Democrats and the President.\n\nHis plan however appeared to be as much an effort to ease his own political predicament on the shutdown as a true attempt to tempt Democrats into a deal as it did not seriously address their demands and he did not consult them before making his announcement.\n\nHouse Democrats have passed a number of bills that would reopen the government or individual agencies, but they have gone nowhere in the Senate.\n\nSenate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been on the sidelines since before Christmas, signaled an effort to raise pressure on Democrats by promising to put Trump's proposal on the Senate floor next week. Previously, McConnell said he would only move on bills that had the support of the President and Democrats.\n\n\"I commend the President for his leadership in proposing this bold solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\n\"Compromise in divided government means that everyone can't get everything they want every time. The President's proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nAnd Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has emerged as a frequent Trump critic after only a few weeks in the chamber also backed the plan.\n\n\"@POTUS has put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border. I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same,\" Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut there was immediate pushback from the far right -- in a reminder of the criticism by conservative pundits that caused Trump to pull out of a deal to keep the government open late last year.\n\n\"Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\" said Ann Coulter on Twitter, referring to former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush.\n\n\"100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals. So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall,\" Coulter wrote in another tweet.\n\nTrump's proposal includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nThough Trump did bring up the issue of DACA recipients, the President's refusal to offer a permanent path to citizenship is a deal breaker for Democrats.\n\nLast year, Democratic senators worked on a deal with Republicans which offered $25 billion in border funding in exchange for a permanent path to citizenship for some 1.8 million Dreamers. Trump walked away from the offer.\n\nIn 2017, Trump's administration announced plans to phase out the DACA program, and Trump has previously said he would wait to address protections for its recipients after a Supreme Court ruling on the matter.\n\nThe makings of the proposal\n\nA source familiar with the discussions said the President tasked his son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Vice President Mike Pence with working to craft a broader compromise proposal that they could present to Democrats.\n\nThe three men set out to put together a \"fair and reasonable proposal,\" engaging with numerous members of Congress in recent weeks, before discussing the effort with Trump in recent days.\n\nThe White House wanted it to look like they had a valid reason for canceling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's trip to Afghanistan, and feared that if there was no movement this weekend -- no meetings, no negotiations or no speeches -- it would look bad, two people familiar with the schedule told CNN.\n\nTrump's proposal came together over the last week, with White House officials working into Friday night to hammer out the details and how Trump would lay it out in his Saturday afternoon address.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had floated such a compromise to the President as early as late December.\n\nAnother source told CNN the plan is modeled after proposals Democrats have supported and voted for in the past in an added effort to pressure them back to the negotiating table.\n\nThough he didn't come up with or help craft the proposal, McConnell offered suggestions over the last two days as to how to move the plan forward, a source familiar told CNN.

The aide called it a non-serious offer.\n\nA similar deal was rebuffed by Democrats in March during an earlier government funding debate, according to a Republican and Democratic aide at the time. Republican leaders and the White House offered two-and-a-half years of protections, without a path to citizenship, for DACA beneficiaries in exchange for border wall funding. Democrats rejected it then, and asked for a path to citizenship, fearing that it would give Trump his wall money while making DACA recipients eligible for deportation after a few years. The White House said no to a path to citizenship, and negotiations collapsed.\n\nThe White House has said repeatedly that the time to address the Dreamers would be after the Supreme Court rules on whether Trump\u2019s attempt to deport them can go forward, and has requested the issue be considered urgently. But the top U.S. court indicated on Friday that it wouldn\u2019t hear a case on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, any time soon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi entered a long holiday weekend with no sign their acrimonious standoff was any closer to an end. But as the pain of the shutdown grows daily, the pressure is on to find a solution.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Trump doubled down on his demand for a wall and Trump took a swipe at Pelosi as he prepared to board Marine One at the White House.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s being controlled by the radical left,\u201d Trump said, adding that he hopes she\u2019ll come around to see \u201ceverybody knows, that walls work.\u201d\n\nThe president also cited a new assemblage of migrants heading for the U.S. border as justification for a wall, and said he\u2019s disappointed that \u201cMexico is not stopping them.\u201d The comment echoed one made earlier on Twitter.\n\nAlthough Trump has hinted that he might declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and fund the wall if other options failed, he doesn\u2019t plan to do so on Saturday, a person familiar with the president\u2019s thinking said on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s tweet late Friday previewing the announcement capped three days of dramatic twists in a clash between the president and the speaker -- second in line to the presidency behind Vice President Mike Pence -- that\u2019s become highly personal.\n\nThe president blocked Pelosi and a congressional delegation from visiting U.S. troops Afghanistan over the weekend, a day after she said he should postpone his Jan. 29 State of the Union address.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saw Pelosi\u2019s move to ask Trump to not appear for the State of the Union as a stunt and a capitulation to progressives in the House Democratic caucus that would only drag out the shutdown, said a person familiar with McConnell\u2019s thinking. He encouraged the administration to offer a proposal that could attract Democratic support; the White House was already working on an alternative.\n\nIn canceling Pelosi\u2019s military flight, Trump said he wanted her to remain in Washington to negotiate. But as of Friday, Pelosi\u2019s office had received no White House invitation for further talks, even as Trump moved on other fronts, including scheduling a second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the end of February.\n\nThe White House didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on the possibility of Pelosi being invited for meetings over the weekend.\n\nThe dispute over the wall led to the impasse, which has closed nine government departments and dozens of agencies since Dec. 22. Democrats are trying to craft their own border security plan that doesn\u2019t include new wall funding.\n\n\u201cWhat really has to happen is Nancy Pelosi needs to come back to the White House or send others here who are actually willing to converse and negotiate and come up with the money for border security,\u201d Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in an appearance on Fox Business Network. \u201cOur doors are open.\u201d\n\nIn Ankara, Turkey, Republican Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina predicted that the stalemate could be resolved soon, citing \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d meetings he\u2019s had with Democrats and Vice President Michael Pence. \u201cI believe there is a deal that can be reached fairly quickly,\u201d Graham told Bloomberg on Saturday.\n\nDemocrats have rallied around the position that only after the government opens would they be willing to talk about increased border security, a stance Durbin reiterated on Saturday: Trump and McConnell \u201cmust open the government today,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans said Democrats would have to offer more than the $1.3 billion in border funds they\u2019ve already put on the table.\n\nPelosi said this week that her party is willing to talk about increased border security money but not to fulfill Trump\u2019s campaign promise to build a 2,000 mile wall.\n\n\u201cIn case I wasn\u2019t clear, 90 percent of the drugs coming into the country come through the ports of entry. Let\u2019s use resources to expand the ports of entry,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThis has to be evidence-based, not notion-mongered.\u201d\n\nBy presenting their own proposal, Democrats can inoculate themselves against charges by Trump and his supporters that they\u2019re in favor of open borders.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to say what we\u2019re for, not just what we\u2019re against,\u201d former Vice President Joe Biden, a potential challenger to Trump in 2020, said in an interview in Washington.\n\nPelosi, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey of New York and Homeland Security subcommittee Chairwoman Lucille Roybal-Allard of California and their staffs are seeking to draft the plan by Tuesday.\n\n\u201cA lot of members are asking what is our plan here,\u201d Roybal-Allard said. \u201cWe are looking at all the options.\u201d\n\nRoybal-Allard said that she\u2019d be looking at adding personnel, technology, and infrastructure at the border as well as securing ports of entry and funding more immigration judges to process backlogs of immigration cases.\n\nHumanitarian aid for asylum-seekers and aid for Central American countries to encourage migrants to remain at home are also on the table, as is facilitating trade between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nSeparately, to illustrate their commitment to border security, Democrats are adding border provisions to a package of six bills funding other parts of the government and set for a vote next week. Totaling about $1 billion, half the money would be used to strengthen security at ports of entry and half to fund more immigration judges.\n\nDeveloping a House plan could ease the concern of moderate Democrats that the party is not doing enough to try to resolve the impasse.\n\nGreisa Martinez Rosas, a DACA recipient and a leader of the activist group United We Dream, said she\u2019ll \u201cneed to see the details\u201d of Trump\u2019s offer, \u201cbut we are deeply skeptical that this is not just another trick to hurt even more immigrant families.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, she said Trump nixed DACA and TPS and has rejected compromises while attempting \u201cto use our lives to get his wall and increase his deportation agents to hurt immigrants.\u201d", "stance": "C", "url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2019/01/19/democrats-signal-they-reject-new-trump-plan/BkelIN5RhnprxOunKuVUON/story.html", "imageUrl": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/rf/image_585w/Boston/2011-2020/2019/01/19/BostonGlobe.com/Politics/Images/6c85302f830c4d52a7e377899cba8944-6c85302f830c4d52a7e377899cba8944-0.jpg", "datePublished": "2019-01-19T20:42:00Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Fact-checking Donald Trump's border wall speech", "author": "info@tabnak.ir", "source": "Tabnak.ir", "summary": "In his first formal address to the nation from the Oval Office, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a national threat and humanitarian crisis occurring along the US-Mexico border, saying his signature border wall would provide a solution.", "text": "\u062a\u0645\u0627\u0645 \u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0645\u0627\u062f\u06cc \u0648 \u0645\u0639\u0646\u0648\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0633\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0645\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642 \u0628\u0647 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0646\u0627\u06a9 \u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f \u0648 \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0637\u0627\u0644\u0628 \u0628\u0627 \u0630\u06a9\u0631 \u0645\u0646\u0628\u0639 \u0628\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0627\u0633\u062a.", "stance": "C", "url": "https://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/868118/fact-checking-donald-trumps-border-wall-speech", "imageUrl": null, "datePublished": "2019-01-09T05:09:54Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Axios: Trump to propose DACA, TPS extensions for wall", "author": "tips@hotair.com (Hot Air Network, LLC), Hot Air Network, LLC", "source": "Hotair.com", "summary": "Blink or bluff? The post Axios: Trump to propose DACA, TPS extensions for wall appeared first on Hot Air.", "text": "Could this be the deal that breaks the logjam \u2014 or is it a bluff that intends to break Nancy Pelosi\u2019s public support? In his 3 pm ET address today, Axios reports that Donald Trump will offer to extend both the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program as well as temporary protected status (TPS) for his $5.7 billion funding for a border wall. Such an offer could reset the political ground, and might have some moderate Democrats in favor of grabbing what they can to end the shutdown:\n\nThe offer is expected to include Trump\u2019s $5.7 billion demand for wall money in exchange for the BRIDGE Act \u2014 which would extend protections for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \u2014 and also legislation to extend the legal status of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, according to a source with direct knowledge.\n\nCNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond confirmed the story a little later in the morning. Jonathan Swan reports that Mike Pence has been working Capitol Hill to get some kind of swap that will allow both sides to declare victory. Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones working the aisles, however. Swan also notes that some Democrats have tried to work this from the other side by increasing border-security spending in their latest funding bill, intending to put pressure back on Trump to accept other security measures besides a wall:\n\nHouse Democrats have added more than $1 billion in border-related spending to a package of funding bills that would reopen most of the government, even as President Trump said he would have a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d on Saturday about the border and the shutdown stalemate. \u2026 The proposal to include more spending on border measures is scheduled for a vote next week, according to two senior Democratic officials. The plan reflects a shift in strategy by congressional Democrats, who have maintained that they would not give the president a counterproposal until he drops his insistence on a wall and signs legislation to reopen the government. It is an attempt to rebut Mr. Trump\u2019s repeated portrayal of Democrats as opponents of border security and their denunciation of his wall as an embrace of open borders. About half the money, $524 million, would be for additional infrastructure at ports of entry on the border, one Democrat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the plans have not been formally announced, while $563 million more would be inserted to fund 75 immigration judges, who adjudicate the claims of migrants who make asylum claims at the border.\n\nThat\u2019s clearly going to be insufficient, even for public-relations purposes. The pressing issue at the border isn\u2019t the infrastructure at the ports of entry; it\u2019s how many people avoid ports of entry by crossing elsewhere on the 1900-mile frontier. When we\u2019ve solved the latter, or at least greatly mitigated it, we\u2019ll see more people presenting themselves properly at ports of entry, and fewer resources will have to be used to prevent entries elsewhere. At that point we\u2019ll need more infrastructure spending at ports of entry, but it\u2019s a question of sequencing and priorities.\n\nWill Trump\u2019s offer be any more effective? Possibly, because DACA is important enough to Democrats that Chuck Schumer initiated a government shutdown almost exactly a year ago to rescue it. He took a beating over it from his own constituencies when he retreated on the shutdown. DACA advocates have been waiting a long time for Democrats to deliver a win for the program, and it will be tough to pass this up. Plus, Democrats have been advocating hard for TPS extensions since the Trump administration began to cut them off. They would get two wins \u2014 albeit temporary \u2014 in trade for a portion of the wall. It\u2019s going to be tough to explain to the \u201cdreamers\u201d that Democrats thought it better to leave them at risk of deportation rather than build a wall that won\u2019t bother them one bit.\n\nThat might be enough for Pelosi\u2019s frosh class in the House. Most of them came from districts that had elected Republicans in the past, and some of them won by pledging not to support Pelosi and her hard-Left agenda. Winning extensions on DACA and TPS while ending a very unpopular shutdown might appeal a great deal to them as we approach its monthiversary. If she turns it down, Pelosi might face a palace revolt within weeks of her installation as Speaker. With enmity running as high as it is between Pelosi and Trump, though, it almost seems impossible that she will accept any funding for the wall, period.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit curious that Trump\u2019s coming out with the first significant shift off of opening positions. The Art of the Deal author would likely remind anyone under any other circumstances that the person who blinks first is the loser in a standoff. In this situation, though, that might be reversed, given the obstinacy on both sides that have characterized this shutdown. Until 3 pm ET today, this has been Trump\u2019s shutdown because of his insistence on a wall without any tradeoffs to benefit Democrats politically. If he makes this offer, it might change the political dynamic just from the reasonableness of the proposal.\n\nBear in mind, however, that this deal was obvious from Day 1 of the shutdown, and since last year\u2019s shutdown too. Neither side had any incentives to help the other side save a little face until now. In fact, the DACA/TPS-for-wall swap is the obvious permanent solution, too: $25 billion for the entire wall project in exchange for a statutory DACA program and new parameters for existing TPS refugees. Both sides keep selling their voters on triumphalism rather than compromise, which is why voters look for disruptors rather than effective governance.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re heading toward Month Two of the shutdown, unless Pelosi decides that half a loaf is better than none. Or more to the point, unless Pelosi realizes that she\u2019ll own the shutdown if she doesn\u2019t take the deal.", "stance": "L", "url": "https://hotair.com/archives/2019/01/19/axios-trump-propose-daca-tps-extensions-wall/", "imageUrl": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/trump-border.jpg", "datePublished": "2019-01-19T16:31:58Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "The Latest: Trump's plan trades protection for immigrants", "author": "", "source": "Associated Press", "summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on the partial government shutdown (all times local):", "text": "President Donald Trump speaks about the partial government shutdown, immigration and border security in the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House, in Washington, Saturday, Jan. 19, 2019.

So many different problems including gangs like MS-13. We don't want them in the United States...We need a great barrier, and if we don't have it, it's never going to work,' he said.\n\nThe shutdown may cripple the nation during the holiday season as thousands will be forced to work without pay or will be furloughed, meaning placed on leave without pay.\n\nSome of the Americans forced to work without pay include 53,000 TSA employees, 54,000 customs and border protection agents, postal office workers and air traffic controllers.\n\nThe shutdown will affect nine government departments including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury. NASA and state parks will also lose their funding.\n\nIt means 42,000 Coast Guard employees and 5,000 Forest Service Firefighters will be forced to work without pay, according to projections by the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nHowever, agencies that that are 'essential to the safety of life and protection of property' will continue to operate.\n\nHoliday travel will not be halted in the shutdown as TSA and border agents will continue to work - albeit without pay.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service, Medicare reimbursements, and social security will also continue to be operational in the shut down.\n\nPresident Donald Trump sent his son-in-law Jared along with his incoming chief of staff and Vice President Mike Pence to Capitol Hill to negotiate with the Senate Democratic leader\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walks to his office during ongoing negotiations Friday\n\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer depart after speaking to the media on Thursday\n\nThe government will only be partially shut down as Congress already funded 75 percent of the federal government through September 2019, according to AJC.\n\nAnd no one knows just when the the shut down will end.\n\nTrump himself said he's 'totally prepared for a very long shut down'.\n\nThis is the third government shutdown for the Trump administration. On January 20 of this year a shut down ensued after Republicans refused to fund DACA. Another shutdown followed on February 9, which Trump stopped hours later.\n\nThe longest ever government shutdown took place in late 1995 to 1996 and lasted 21 days. In 2013 another shutdown lasted 16 days.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released a statement following the shutdown.\n\n'Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House,' they said. 'But instead of honoring his responsibility to the American people, President Trump threw a temper tantrum and convinced House Republicans to push our nation into a destructive Trump Shutdown in the middle of the holiday season.'\n\nChuck Schumer released a joint statement with Nancy Pelosi following the shutdown at midnight\n\nThe government shut down at dawn on Saturday which left 420,000 Americans forced to work without pay over the holidays and 380,000 federal employees furloughed\n\nA projection of the impacts of the shutdown pictured above showing that 53,000 TSA employees and 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents will be forced to work the holidays without pay\n\nThey continued: 'President Trump has said more than 25 times that he wanted a shutdown and now he has gotten what he wanted.'\n\nThey added that Democrats have offered Republicans 'multiple proposals to keep the government open... which include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security - not the president's ineffective and expensive wall'.\n\nSenators said Friday evening that they would not vote on any additional legislation to keep the government open until the president struck a deal with Democrats.\n\nThe upper chamber adjourned a little after 8pm EDT without coming to a conclusion.\n\nDespite the government shutdown, which closed public parks and monuments, the city of New York independently announced they'd keep Lady Liberty's torch burning using their own funds.\n\nNew York's Governor Cuomo announced Saturday that the state of New York will intervene to keep the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island open and running in light of the shut down, covering the $65,000 a day costs of those operations.\n\nOn Saturday Congress held their own negotiations, scrambling to come to a solution. House members were told they'd get 24 hours' notice before a vote.\n\nBut no conclusion was made as Democrats refused to up the budget amount to $5 billion for the border.\n\n'The irony of this is that we all know this is going to end. It\u2019s not going to be different from the deal the president reneged on,' political pundit Josh Rogin said on CNN.\n\nU.S. government shutdown will impact 800,000 federal workers 420,000 Americans will be forced to work without pay over the holidays, 380,000 will be furloughed (meaning be given unpaid leave), and 30 million small businesses will lose access to loans. Shutdown will impact about 800,000 of the 2.1 million federal employees in the United States, according to Democrats in the House and Senate. 80 percent of the employees of the National Park Service will also be sent home, along with 96 per cent of NASA workers and 86 per cent of the Commerce Department. 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers, air control workers, and postal workers will all work without pay. Nine Departments are effected including the homeland security, transport, commerce, state, agriculture, interior, treasury and housing and urban development. Others such as the Defense Department, Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Health and Human Services have already received funding and will be spared. No visitor services will be provided at tourist attractions such as the nation's national parks, which are frequently visited over the Christmas holidays. According to the LA Times, parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon will likely remain accessible to visitors. However, visitor centers and campsites will probably be closed. It is unlikely bathrooms will be cleaned and maintained also. During the last shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was closed for two days before the state of New York decided to pony up the money necessary to keep it open. The Smithsonian in Washington said it had enough in reserve to keep its museums open through January 1. The post office, Medicare, TSA and social security will continue to operate. One person who will not be the victim of the shutdown is Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigation Russian collusion in Trump's presidential campaign\n\nSaturday's debate focused on not just how much money to allocate to the border, but where the money can be doled out.\n\n'What is fencing, what is land ports of entry, what's technology, what's staffing? I think there's a general agreement ... that we need to do border security. Now's figuring out how much for each amount,' Republican Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma said to CNN.\n\nKEY MOMENTS IN THE SHUTDOWN FIGHT 6:50 AM: President Trump begins his day by instructing Sen.

'We are going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate. There's a very good chance it won't get passed. It's up to the Democrats. So, it's really the Democrat shutdown.' 4:00 PM: President Trump sends senior advisor Jared Kushner, incoming chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Vice President Mike Pence to Capitol Hill to meet with Chuck Schumer. They were also seen meeting with GOP leaders. 5:40 PM: A senior White House official tells DailyMail.com: 'We are still discussing, listening, and working to find way to fund border security and keep the government open.' 5:50 PM: McConnell says the next vote that takes place will be on whatever deal he and Democratic leaders are able to strike with the president. 9:50 PM: Trump declares: 'We are going to have a shutdown, there is nothing we can do about that, because we need the Democrats to give us their votes.' Midnigh: Government is partially shut down\n\n'Right now we're trying to finalize all the final text and to be able to make sure everyone's looked at it, everyone's agreed, signed off on it...Then we'll move to a vote 24 hours from there,' he said on Saturday morning.\n\n'We've agreed in the Senate we're not bringing anything to the floor until we know all three bodies have agreed to it,' he added.\n\nWhat Trump wants is a $5 billion border wall fund for a total of 700 miles of barrier. And he has the support of several Republican officials.\n\n'I commend the president for standing strong on securing the border..He doesn't intent to capitulate. He's not going to,' Senator Ted Cruz said.\n\nFriday ended with McConnell leaving the Capitol saying talks remained 'constructive', which stretched into Saturday's day of no resolution.\n\nOn Friday the president tweeted that he's biding his time, sharing a photo of himself behind the Resolute Desk with a stack of folios containing recently-passed legislation.\n\n'Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now,' he said. 'Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America\u2019s Southern Border!'\n\nTwitter users then poked fun at the president for posting a picture of himself seemingly signing a blank page.\n\nThe government shutdown may prove to be devastating for the U.S. economy if it doesn't get resolved soon.\n\nThe longer it stretches, the more risks the economy faces. Financial markets were already shaken on Thursday when President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the government unless his border wall is funded.\n\nExperts speculate that the shut down could threaten the second-longest U.S. financial expansion on record and could lead to a recession and wane deficit spending.\n\nDirectly the shutdown won't hurt economic growth very much because 75 percent of the government is already funded. But it could shave $1.2 billion off the nation's gross domestic product each week it stretches on, according to S&P Global Ratings.", "stance": "R", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6523051/Trump-tweets-hes-working-hard-negotiating-border-wall-Democrats.html", "imageUrl": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/12/22/04/7725878-0-image-a-15_1545454616370.jpg", "datePublished": "2018-12-22T17:05:13Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Exclusive: Trump plans shutdown compromise Trump speaking to reporters", "author": "AXIOS", "source": "Freerepublic.com", "summary": "President Trump plans to use remarks from the Diplomatic Reception Room on Saturday afternoon to propose a notable immigration compromise, according to sources familiar with the speech.

Steve King on Thursday after the Iowa Republican wondered aloud how the terms \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d and \u201cwhite supremacist\u201d became \u201coffensive\u201d during an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\u201cSteve\u2019s language is reckless, wrong and has no place in our society,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said. \u201cEverything about white supremacy and white nationalism goes against who we are as a nation.\u201d\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) said it was \u201coffensive to try to legitimize those terms.\u201d He credited King for issuing a statement after the story published that said, \u201cI reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define.\u201d\n\nRep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who just became No. 3 in GOP leadership by winning the race for conference chair, tweeted: \u201cThese comments are abhorrent and racist and should have no place in our national discourse.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth McCarthy and Scalise were silent in October when asked for comment on incendiary remarks King had made then,\u201d Felicia Sonmez notes. \u201cAt the time, Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio), then the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, was the only member of House GOP leadership to rebuke King.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cMr. King, in the interview, said he was not a racist,\u201d Trip Gabriel reports in the Times. \u201cHe pointed to his Twitter timeline showing him greeting Iowans of all races and religions in his Washington office. (The same office once displayed a Confederate flag on his desk.) At the same time, he said, he supports immigrants who enter the country legally and fully assimilate because what matters more than race is \u2018the culture of America\u2019 based on values brought to the United States by whites from Europe. \u2018White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization \u2014 how did that language become offensive?\u2019 Mr. King said. \u2018Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cLast week, as the new Congress was sworn in, Mr. King sat on his side of a chamber sharply delineated by demographics,\u201d the story concludes. \u201cThe Democratic majority included record numbers of African-Americans and women, including the first Native American and the first Muslim women. Mr. King\u2019s side was mostly people who look like him. \u2018You could look over there and think the Democratic Party is no country for white men,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump Jr. goes pheasant hunting with Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) near Akron, Iowa, in October 2017. (Lucas Jackson/Reuters)\n\n-- King is not some random backbencher. In the most recent Congress, he chaired the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s prestigious Constitution subcommittee. More than that, though, the Times story lays out King\u2019s influence on President Trump and his role in bringing the debate over a border wall into the mainstream.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s preoccupation with the wall and anti-immigrant politics reflects how he has embraced the once-fringe views of Mr. King,\u201d Trip writes. \u201cMr. King may have been ostracized by some Republicans over his racist remarks and extremist ties, but as much of the nation debates immigration, his views now carry substantial influence on the right. \u2026 Early in Mr. Trump\u2019s term, the president invited Mr. King \u2026 to the Oval Office. There, the president boasted of having raised more money for the congressman\u2019s campaigns than anyone else, including during a 2014 Iowa visit, Mr. King recalled in an interview with The Times. \u2018Yes, Mr. President,\u2019 Mr. King replied. \u2018But I market-tested your immigration policy for 14 years, and that ought to be worth something.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Indeed, King has a long history of making inflammatory comments related to immigration that predates the Trump era. \u201cIn the fall, he voiced support for Faith Goldy, an unsuccessful Toronto mayoral candidate who has promoted the baseless notion that a \u2018white genocide\u2019 is underway,\u201d Isaac Stanley-Becker notes. \u201cShortly thereafter, reports surfaced that King had met in August with members of an Austrian political party founded by former Nazis, during a trip funded by a group that promotes awareness of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s routinely questioned the value of nonwhite diversity. \u201cI\u2019d ask you to go back through history and figure out, where are these contributions that have been made by these other categories of people that you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he told Esquire in 2016. \u201cWhere did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\u201d\n\nIn 2013, he told Newsmax that for every immigrant in the country illegally who becomes valedictorian, there are \u201canother 100 out there that \u2014 they weigh 130 pounds, and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d\n\nThe Weekly Standard reported in November that King jokingly referred to Mexican immigrants as \u201cdirt\u201d while bantering with supporters before a campaign event. When King denied it, the conservative magazine released audio that backed up its reporting. When the publication was shuttered a few weeks later for reasons that had nothing to do with the piece, King celebrated its demise.\n\n-- During a Daily 202 Live interview last June, Scalise ripped Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) for her incendiary comments about confronting Trump\u2019s aides but demurred when I pressed him about King retweeting a self-professed \u201cNazi sympathizer\u201d and then refusing to delete it. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the tweet,\u201d Scalise said, despite it being in the news for several days. \u201cI have not seen the tweet, and you know, maybe we\u2019ll go take a look at it and talk to Steve and see what\u2019s going on there.\u201d\n\nAs the conversation moved to other issues, Scalise circled back to say that it\u2019s important to condemn Nazi sympathizers but stopped short of chastising King. \u201cWe need to be very vocal about condemning that kind of viewpoint, because there are still people out there that try to go under the false impression that the Holocaust didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean people say that, and it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n-- In addition to the substance of King\u2019s comments, there are eight other factors that might explain why Republican leaders are more willing to publicly break with him than they have been in the past:\n\n1. The midterms showed King could be defeated. He won his ninth term in November by only three percentage points, even though Trump had carried the district by 27 points in 2016. That was without national Democrats investing any resources to support Democrat J.D. Scholten, a former independent-league baseball player.\n\nDuring the run-up to the midterms, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R) declined to remove King as the co-chair of her campaign for a full term. \u201cI can't be held responsible for everyone's comments,\u201d she told reporters, adding that she \u201cstrongly disagreed with the comments that he\u2019s made.\u201d\n\nThis week, Reynolds announced that she will not endorse King in 2020. \u201cThe last election was a wake-up call \u2014 for it to be that close,\u201d she told the Des Moines NBC affiliate WHO on Wednesday. \u201cThat indicates that it does open the door for other individuals to take a look at that. \u2026 I will stay out of the primary. I'm not going to weigh in.\u201d\n\n2. King now faces a credible primary challenger, which he has not in the past. On Wednesday, Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra (R) \u2013 an assistant majority leader and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \u2013 announced that he will take on King for the GOP nomination. Feenstra argued that he can be more effective at advancing the Trump agenda. \u201cToday, Iowa\u2019s 4th District doesn\u2019t have a voice in Washington, because our current representative\u2019s caustic nature has left us without a seat at the table,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe don\u2019t need any more sideshows or distractions.\u201d\n\nLast night, Feenstra sought to raise money off King\u2019s latest comments, which he described as \u201canother embarrassment\u201d:\n\nAnother day, another embarrassment. This behavior hurts our district and our conservative cause. We need an effective conservative. Congressman King isn't. Chip in to #RetireSteveKing here: https://t.co/tTXNxX19ph \u2014 Randy Feenstra (@RandyFeenstra) January 10, 2019\n\nKing\u2019s son, who manages his campaigns, responded to Feenstra\u2019s announcement by highlighting Trump\u2019s previous endorsement of King as \u201cthe world\u2019s most conservative human being.\u201d\n\nA second Republican, Army veteran Bret Richards, also announced that he will run this week. \u201cI\u2019m hearing there may be at least one more GOP challenger who hasn\u2019t yet announced as well,\u201d said Kathie Obradovich, the opinion editor at the Des Moines Register.\n\n3. Forcefully condemning King now could dissuade him from seeking a 10th term. Strategists in both parties agree that the odds of the GOP holding the northwest Iowa seat go up dramatically if he doesn\u2019t run again.\n\nNotably, the new chairman of the NRCC, Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), declined to say Thursday whether the party will back the incumbent in 2020. \u201cIt's too early to think about campaigns, I mean that's two years away,\u201d Emmer told the Hill, arguing that the committee does not typically \u201cplay in primaries.\u201d Regarding the Times story, the chairman said: \u201cI disagree with the statements as they've been characterized, as I understand them, and it's not helpful.\u201d\n\n4. Iowa will be a battleground again in 2020 for president, Senate and House \u2014 and King could be a drag on the rest of the GOP ticket.\n\nDemocrats picked up two of Iowa\u2019s four House seats in November, and Republicans promise to target both of them again next year. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is also seeking a second term, and she is considered one of the three or four most vulnerable GOP incumbents in the country. Ernst\u2019s press office did not respond to my request for comment yesterday on whether she still backs King after his comments to the Times.\n\nVeteran Iowa political journalist David Yepsen thinks Scholten\u2019s chances of being able to beat Ernst in the Senate race are higher than beating anyone but King in the Fourth District. \u201cArguably less of a long shot,\u201d he posted on Twitter. Interestingly, Scholten retweeted that.\n\n5. Republican presidential aspirants have been reluctant to cross King in the past because he commands a loyal following among the devoted grass-roots activists who attend low-turnout caucuses in outsize numbers, but there\u2019s no nominating fight to worry about in 2020. At least right now.\n\n6. Because they now control the majority, House Democrats can force Republicans to take a position on King. Several Democrats, led by Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), are calling on leadership to quickly take up a resolution that would formally censure King for his comments. It could pass with a simple majority. It would force every Republican to take an on-the-record position about their colleague. Ryan\u2019s staff is drafting a censure resolution for him to introduce.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) voiced interest in the effort, per Politico.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.), who was born in Iowa and has been testing the waters for a potential long-shot bid to win the Democratic presidential nomination, also seized on the issue.\n\nSome rank-and-file Republicans appear open to a vote for censure. Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), for example, blasted King\u2019s comments to the Times. \u201cThe embrace of these terms and philosophies are fundamentally wrong and offensive and have no place in Congress, our nation, or anywhere,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAnother Michigan Republican, Rep. Justin Amash, added: \u201cThis is an embrace of racism, and it has no place in Congress or anywhere.\u201d\n\nSuggesting that he recognizes the underlying political dynamics have shifted, King sounded less defiant and combative yesterday than he has during previous firestorms. In addition to a news release, he gave a sit-down interview to NBC News. \u201cI reject white nationalism. I reject white supremacy. It's not part of any of my ideology,\u201d he said in his Capitol Hill office. \u201cI reject anyone who carries that ideology.\u201d\n\n7. The donor community and the business world have turned on King. Corporate America, which has long been more supportive of immigration than other elements of the GOP coalition, has become more activist in the Trump era under pressure from employees and customers. During the home stretch before the midterms, several corporate PACs pulled support for King. Among them: the chipmaker Intel, pet-food-maker Purina, the dairy Land O\u2019Lakes and the ham producers at Smithfield.\n\n8. Conservative thought leaders are ready to write King out of the movement. The model is William F. Buckley\u2019s legendary crusade against Robert Welch and the John Birch Society in the pages of National Review. Rich Lowry, now the editor of NR, called King\u2019s comments yesterday \u201csimply contemptible.\u201d\n\nStephen Hayes, who as editor in chief of the Weekly Standard made the call to publish the audio of King joking about immigrants as \u201cdirt,\u201d said yesterday: \u201cWhat sane, thoughtful conservative would choose to remain in a party home to such an unapologetic bigot?\u201d\n\nBen Shapiro delivered an in-depth, succinct & memorable message to the Conservative Opportunity Society this morning.

Long line to get into the room! pic.twitter.com/TCHEaTY0om \u2014 Steve King (@SteveKingIA) March 21, 2018\n\nConservative pundit Ben Shapiro, the editor in chief of the Daily Wire, who publicly appeared with King last March, broke with him yesterday and urged followers to donate to Feenstra. In March 2017, when King tweeted that \u201cwe can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies,\u201d Shapiro rallied to his defense. \u201cThe deep desire to paint Republicans as racists rather than defenders of Western cultural superiority leads the media to lie,\u201d he wrote. But Shapiro updated that post yesterday to say he now realizes that he \u201cgave far too generous an interpretation of King's words.\u201d\n\nThe executive producer of Shapiro\u2019s show on the Daily Wire posted his own mea culpa:\n\nI've defended Steve King, most notably on DW Backstage. I've met him a few times, liked him each time, and have not been persuaded by past accusations against him. After this interview, it's clear I was mistaken.

(Carolyn Y. Johnson) Conservative megadonor Robert Mercer's status as a volunteer deputy sheriff in Yuma County, Colo., was revoked. Sheriff Chad Day submitted papers for the revocation on Day's last day in office after he lost his reelection bid, in part because of blowback over Mercer\u2019s purchase of a truck for the sheriff\u2019s official use. (Bloomberg News)\n\nSHUTDOWN LATEST:\n\n-- The White House continues laying the groundwork to declare a national emergency to get money for the border wall, possibly by tapping disaster relief funds. Erica Werner, Josh Dawsey, Mike DeBonis and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cThe administration is eyeing unused money in the Army Corps of Engineers budget, specifically a disaster spending bill passed by Congress last year that includes $13.9 billion allocated but not spent for civil works projects, two people with knowledge of the developments said Thursday. Trump has urged the Army Corps to determine how fast contracts could be signed and whether construction could begin within 45 days, according to one of the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the preparations. The list includes dozens of flood control projects in areas affected by recent natural disasters, including the Texas coastline inundated by Hurricane Harvey and parts of Puerto Rico battered by Hurricane Maria. The military construction budget is also being looked at as a potential source for unspent funds, with billions more potentially available there.\n\n\u201cSome 800,000 federal workers are about to miss their first paychecks since the shutdown began Dec. 22, and problems plaguing shuttered national parks, food inspection processes and other federal services are multiplying. The Senate unanimously passed legislation Thursday that would guarantee back pay to furloughed federal workers once the shutdown ends, although thousands of government contractors who have been furloughed may never recoup their losses. [Trump] reiterated Thursday that he may declare a national emergency if Democrats don\u2019t give him what he wants. \u2018Now if we don\u2019t make a deal with Congress, most likely I will do that,\u2019 Trump said to Fox News host Sean Hannity about an emergency declaration in an interview that aired Thursday night. ... At the same time, House Democrats pressed forward with their strategy of passing individual spending bills to reopen portions of the federal government that have been closed in the shutdown.\u201d\n\nBut some Democrats, while publicly vowing to fight an emergency declaration through the courts, see a silver lining to the potential move: \u201cOne Democratic aide called an emergency declaration an \u2018elegant way out of this mess\u2019 \u2014 one that would allow Trump and Republicans to declare to their most fervent supporters that they had taken Democrats to the brink, while Democrats would quickly move to tie up any construction in the courts. The House and Senate could move quickly to pass a bill to reopen the government, predicated on assurances from Trump that he would sign the legislation. \u2026 Many Democrats also say that an emergency declaration would benefit them politically by unifying their party while splitting Republicans, creating unease among some conservatives who have expressed discomfort with a president sidestepping Congress in a way they might see as similar to how President Barack Obama circumvented Congress on immigration.\u201d\n\nA separate effort among a group of Republican senators to craft a compromise that could reopen the government ended in failure: \u201cThese deal-minded Senate Republicans had shuttled Thursday morning between meetings with [Mitch McConnell] and Vice President Pence, batting around a proposal that would include Trump\u2019s desired $5.7 billion in wall funding, and a renewable, three-year status for certain immigrants brought illegally to the country as children, along with other provisions. But by midafternoon Thursday, Pence poured cold water on the idea, telling reporters at the Capitol that Trump wanted to wait on trying to make a deal for \u2018dreamers\u2019 until the Supreme Court had ruled on [DACA]. [Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.)] was glum afterward about where things stood, saying he has \u2018never been more depressed about moving forward than right now.\u2019 Not long after that he issued his statement backing a national emergency declaration.\u201d\n\n-- Jared Kushner has been urging Trump not to issue an emergency declaration. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Michael C. Bender, Kristina Peterson and Peter Nicholas report: \u201cDeclaring a national emergency, an option Mr. Trump has been leaning toward, shouldn\u2019t be used to try to win a messaging war against Democrats opposed to a wall, Mr. Kushner said in a recent Oval Office meeting, [White House] officials said. Instead, Mr. Kushner argued an emergency should be invoked only if it creates a clear path for the White House to build the wall, the key issue in the standoff between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats that has led to the shutdown. \u2018Let\u2019s stop doing things just to do them,\u2019 Mr. Kushner said, according to officials familiar with the meeting.\u201d\n\n-- The White House is operating with less than half of its full-time staff as Trump digs in on his immigration demands. The New York Times\u2019s Katie Rogers reports: \u201cThe White House has stopped paying its water bill. Desks of some furloughed employees, whose job can include such drudgeries as helping their bosses work the copy machine, sit empty in the West Wing. \u2026 But multiple administration officials have stressed this week that despite the shutdown, it is still business as usual. \u2026 Still, while Trump administration officials emphasize the normality, others who have endured lengthy shutdowns warned of the broader effects on the White House staff, including an inevitable slowdown in accomplishing important policy decisions with fewer workers.\u201d\n\n-- Trump's team is also seeking to resume more stalled federal services, sparking increasing complaints of executive overreach. Damian Paletta reports: \u201cThe message, conveyed during a conference call between top officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget and federal agencies, is part of a broader effort to keep large parts of the federal government running while [Trump] digs in for a lengthy battle over a border wall. \u2026 The rapid and in many cases unprecedented scope of OMB\u2019s directives has prompted criticism from Democrats and some Republicans that the White House is bending the rules to contain political fallout. \u2026 Keeping basic functions of government intact during the shutdown has also taken the administration into uncharted legal territory, reversing precedents as it searches for ways to fund efforts for which Congress has not appropriated any money.\u201d\n\n-- Construction of the wall could trigger more legal fights over the government attempting to seize private property through eminent domain. Katie Zezima and Mark Berman report: \u201cPrevious eminent domain attempts along the Texas border have led to more than a decade of court battles, some of which date to George W. Bush\u2019s administration and have yet to be resolved. Many landowners \u2026 are vowing to fight anew. \u2026 The Texas Civil Rights Project is now trying to let people know that they are not required to sign over access to their land. They are going door-to-door in some neighborhoods, letting people know their rights, and they are running digital ads and spots on local radio stations.\u201d\n\n-- Visiting the border, Trump dubiously insisted that Mexico would still eventually pay for his wall. Philip Rucker and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201cAt a U.S. Border Patrol station, where he attended a roundtable on immigration and border security, Trump ... maintained [it] would eventually be paid for by Mexico \u2018many, many times over\u2019 through a new trade deal that has yet to be ratified by Congress. \u2018I didn\u2019t mean, \u201cPlease write me a check,\u201d\u2019 Trump said of his oft-made claim that Mexico would pay for the wall. During the 2016 campaign, Trump\u2019s campaign sent The Washington Post a memo detailing its plan for Mexico to make \u2018a one-time payment of $5-10 billion\u2019 to pay for the border wall. Even if approved by Congress, the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal would not necessarily contribute more money to federal coffers, as countries do not \u2018lose\u2019 money on trade deficits.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cThe episode illustrates how [Trump\u2019s] routine application of falsehoods, exaggerations and lies in service of political combat has come back to burn him,\u201d David Nakamura explains. \u201cHe did say [Mexico would directly pay for the wall] \u2014 at least 212 times during his campaign and dozens more since he took office. \u2026 And now during the shutdown, the White House is searching far and wide for potential pots of money it can tap \u2026 \u2018The story keeps changing by the day \u2014 like everything,\u2019 said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, a vice president at New America, a liberal think tank, who served as a White House domestic policy adviser under [Obama]. Of Trump\u2019s original plan for funding the wall, she added: \u2018They had no earthly idea how they would get Mexico to do that, so they came up with an idea to try to pass the laugh test, which they didn\u2019t do.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- \u201cWhen [Trump] headed to one of the busiest areas along the Texas-Mexico border Thursday morning, he was dressed for a natural disaster,\u201d fashion critic Robin Givhan writes. \u201cHe was scheduled for a roundtable discussion about immigration and border security in McAllen, Tex., and a security briefing at the Rio Grande. Yet there was no wildfire, earthquake or rogue hurricane bearing down on either of these places. Frankly, the weather reports looked fairly pleasant. The ground was not shifting. But no matter. The point was not whether there was scorched rubble to navigate or water-soaked sofas and mattresses around which to maneuver. The clothes were a symbolic flourish to underscore the message: The border itself is the disaster.\u201d\n\nTHE HUMAN TOLL:\n\n-- Some government employees have started selling household items online to help make ends meet. Taylor Telford reports: \u201cA federal worker in Morgantown, W.Va., took to Facebook this week to sell welding tools, left behind by his deceased father-in-law. Another, a die-hard Star Wars fan in Woodbridge, Va., did the same with a life-size replica of Kylo Ren\u2019s lightsaber. A single father in Indiana hosted a sale on eBay with five pages of things found around the house, including Bibles, Nintendo bedsheets and Dr. Seuss neckties. \u2018Sells for $93.88 at Walmart. Asking $10,\u2019 a government worker wrote on a Craigslist ad for a Lulu Ladybug rocking chair. \u2018We need money to pay bills.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The FBI Agents Association warned that today\u2019s missed paycheck could affect security clearances of their members. Devlin Barrett, Tom Jackman and Nick Miroff report: \u201cIn a letter to the White House and lawmakers, FBIAA leaders wrote that their agents \u2018are subject to high security standards that include rigorous and routine financial background checks. . . . Missing payments on debts could create delays in securing or renewing security clearances, and could even disqualify agents from continuing to serve in some cases.\u2019 [FBIAA President Thomas] O\u2019Connor said FBI investigations already are being affected. No one at the FBI is getting paid, but investigators are still working while much of their support staffs, including some surveillance experts, are not, O\u2019Connor said.\u201d\n\nAn Earnings and Leave Statement pay stub that air traffic controllers saw online Thursday for the first time shows $0 in net pay. (Obtained by The Washington Post)\n\n-- \u201cAir traffic controllers get their first shutdown pay stub: $0.00,\u201d by Mike Laris: \u201cBefore Corey Soignet had hundreds of lives in his hands, hour after hour, in the airspace above Houston\u2019s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, he spent years guiding military aircraft. He had joined the Air National Guard with an eye toward becoming a pilot, but found being an air traffic controller such meaningful work that he made it his career. He\u2019s learned the \u2018hyper focus\u2019 needed to help guide aircraft through night skies and brutal storms. On Thursday, Soignet \u2014 with 22 years of experience working for the military and Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 got a look at his wages for the last two weeks of work helping keep U.S. skies and travelers safe. His net pay? $0.00. \u2026 Soignet knew it was coming, but it was jarring nonetheless. \u2018Now I don\u2019t know how much I can put toward that credit card,\u2019 he said. \u2018Do I pay half my water bill? Do I have enough money for 30 days or 60 days or six months? You can\u2019t ask people to budget like that.\u2019 \u2026 More than 24,000 FAA employees are working without pay, since their positions are considered vital for \u2018life and safety.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Many farmers, who have largely stood by Trump as he launched his trade war, are starting to reconsider their support. The New York Times\u2019s Jack Healy and Tyler Pager report: \u201cWhile many rural conservatives may loathe the idea of Big Government, farmers and the federal government are welded together by dozens of programs and billions of dollars in spending. Now, farmers and farm groups say that federal crop payments have stopped flowing. Farmers cannot get federally backed operating loans to buy seed for their spring planting, or feed for their livestock. They cannot look up new government data about beef prices or soybean yields to make decisions about planting and selling their goods in an ever-changing global market.\u201d\n\n-- Experts warned the funding lapse could affect the 2020 Census, even as the Census Bureau says it has enough money for up to eight weeks of work. Tara Bahrampour reports: \u201cThe bureau is relying on $1.056 billion in forward funding from the fiscal 2018 bill, which can be used only for 2020 Census activities and not for other work, to last into mid to late February. But Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former staff director of the House census oversight subcommittee, estimated it would be hard to work full-bore on that amount of funding until then. \u2018I believe they will be able to last that long only if they delay or slow-walk some of the less urgent but no less important preparations,\u2019 she said.\u201d\n\n-- More immigration fallout: Some foreign tech workers are considering moves to Canada as Trump threatens their visa program. Emily Rauhala reports: \u201cTrump has vowed to crack down on the H-1B visa program, which allows 85,000 foreigners per year to work in \u2018specialty occupations\u2019 in the United States. But there are no new rules yet, creating a climate of uncertainty and fear, particularly in Silicon Valley. \u2026 Immigration lawyers and recruiters on both sides of the border say the number of inquiries from nervous H-1B holders has skyrocketed since 2017. A small group of Canadian entrepreneurs are dropping into Silicon Valley to persuade companies that rely on foreign tech workers to move them across the border.\u201d\n\nBut Trump tweeted this morning that his administration may propose a potential pathway to citizenship for H-1B visa holders:\n\nH1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2019\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Must-see TV: Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen will testify publicly before Congress next month. Karoun Demirjian and Matt Zapotosky report: \u201cCohen agreed to the Feb. 7 appearance voluntarily, [House Oversight Committee Chairman] Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) said in a statement. \u2018I want to make clear that we have no interest in inappropriately interfering with any ongoing criminal investigations, and to that end, we are in the process of consulting with special counsel [Bob] Mueller\u2019s office,\u2019 Cummings said, promising that the panel would announce more information about the hearing in the coming weeks. \u2026 Cohen said ... that he had accepted Cummings\u2019s invitation to testify \u2018in furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers.\u2019 \u2018I look forward to having the privilege of being afforded a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired,\u2019 he continued in the statement.\u201d\n\n-- Bob Mueller's prosecutors questioned one of Trump\u2019s campaign pollsters. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Katelyn Polantz report: \u201cMueller's team met with pollster Tony Fabrizio in February 2018, an interview that has not been previously reported and takes on new significance after Manafort's attorneys revealed Tuesday that Mueller's team is still interested in how Manafort shared polling data with his Russian intelligence-linked colleague. \u2026 A veteran pollster and political strategist, Fabrizio worked on Ukrainian elections with Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster beginning in the spring of 2016. A source familiar with the special counsel's interest said Fabrizio's interview included questions about his polling work for Manafort in Ukraine rather than his internal Trump campaign polling. It is not clear what other topics were broached in the interview or whether it solely focused on Fabrizio's knowledge of Manafort's business dealings.\u201d\n\n-- Trump said he knew nothing about Manafort sharing campaign polling data with a Russian associate. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question as he left the White House to travel to the border. (John Wagner)\n\n-- Filings from the Mueller investigation indicate the special counsel may weigh Trump\u2019s public statements when considering whether he committed obstruction of justice. CNN\u2019s Evan Perez, Pamela Brown and Laura Jarrett report: \u201cAs [Mueller] wraps up his Russia probe, investigators have focused on conflicting public statements by [Trump] and his team that could be seen as an effort to influence witnesses and obstruct justice, according to people familiar with the investigation. \u2026 Court filings from [Michael Cohen\u2019s plea] included allegations related to false public statements \u2014 not usually considered illegal since they aren't made directly to investigators. A December sentencing memo filed by Mueller's office notes that Cohen's lies were amplified in public statements, \u2018including to other potential witnesses.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Attorney general nominee William Barr met with a handful of Democratic senators who voiced concerns about his past criticism of the Mueller probe. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201c\u2018The Mueller probe is the big issue for me \u2026 he reassured to some extent. The hard questions have to get asked in the public and get on the record,\u2019 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), the Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, said of her Thursday morning meeting with Barr. \u2026 Feinstein is one of five Judiciary Committee Democrats who met with Barr on Thursday, after several complained they were being iced out of his schedule and being told it was due to the partial government shutdown.\u201d\n\n-- After meeting with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin behind closed doors, House Democrats called for a delay in easing sanctions on a Russian company controlled by an ally of Vladimir Putin. Jeanne Whalen reports: \u201cTreasury notified Congress last month that it planned to lift sanctions on Rusal, an aluminum company controlled by Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \u2026 \u2018This, with stiff competition, mind you, was one of the worst classified briefings we\u2019ve received from the Trump administration,\u2019 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said after the briefing. \u2018The secretary barely testified. He answered some questions, but he didn\u2019t give testimony.\u2019 Asked whether House Democrats were considering introducing a resolution of disapproval to try to stop Treasury from easing the sanctions, as Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer has done in the Senate, Pelosi said: \u2018We\u2019ll see.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Federal prosecutors are probing whether Ukrainian lawmakers and business leaders who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration were there to try to ease sanctions on Russia. The New York Times\u2019s Kenneth P. Vogel, Scott Shane, Mark Mazzetti and Iuliia Mendel report: \u201cEvidence of the Ukrainians\u2019 presence eventually prompted interest from [Mueller] as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and has spawned a number of related inquiries by federal prosecutors. The investigations are playing out against growing indications that some of the Ukrainians who came to Washington for the inaugural, or their allies, were promoting grand bargains, or \u2018peace\u2019 plans, that aligned with Russia\u2019s interests, including by lifting sanctions. Such a deal would not just have given the new administration additional flexibility to bring Moscow into American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, but could also have eased the way for a cast of characters with ties to Mr. Trump \u2014 some of whom in turn had ties to the Ukrainians who came to Washington \u2014 to move ahead on business deals that had been complicated by the sanctions.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump shakes hands with Republican Senate candidate Josh Hawley while walking offstage at the end of a campaign rally on Nov. 5 in Cape Girardeau, Mo. (Jeff Roberson/AP)\n\nTHE NEW CONGRESS:\n\n-- Missouri state auditors have started a probe into Josh Hawley\u2019s tenure as attorney general, a process that will include \u201cheightened scrutiny\u201d into allegations the Republican illegally used state resources to support his successful Senate campaign. From McClatchy D.C.: \u201cIn this case, the state\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft asked [State Auditor Nicole] Galloway, a Democrat, to use her subpoena power to aid his own investigation into whether Hawley violated a state law that bars elected officials from using public funds to support political campaigns. Ashcroft\u2019s request for Galloway\u2019s help followed a report by The Kansas City Star in October that out-of-state campaign consultants, who would go on to run Hawley\u2019s Senate campaign, gave direct guidance and tasks to taxpayer-funded staff in the attorney general\u2019s office as they sought to raise his national profile. \u2026\n\n\u201cEighty-five pages of records released by Hawley\u2019s office shortly before Christmas confirmed The Star\u2019s reporting. Those documents show public employees in his office used private email addresses for official business and frequently took direction from political consultants. The records include conversations conducted on private email addresses between Hawley\u2019s political consultants and his taxpayer-funded staff, starting almost immediately after Hawley was sworn in as attorney general in January 2017. \u2026\n\n\u201cAlso among the cache of records is one titled \u2018gg draft 7/12.\u2019 It appears to be Washington, D.C., political consultant Gail Gitcho\u2019s public relations plan for the attorney general\u2019s office regarding a raid of more than a dozen Asian massage parlors \u2026 The raid was part of a human trafficking and prostitution investigation \u2026 Gitcho, who would go on to help run Hawley\u2019s Senate campaign, gave instructions about how the day should proceed, even going so far as to lay out what Hawley should wear when addressing the media. \u2018Josh should be wearing some sort of law enforcement garb,\u2019 the document said, \u2018like a police jacket and hat.\u2019 On the day of the raid, Hawley wore a badge and lanyard.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) will probably join the House Financial Services Committee, allowing her a perch to take on Wall Street and its influence on Washington. Politico\u2019s Zachary Warmbrodt reports: \u201cThe assignment, which lawmakers say they expect her to receive, would pit the 29-year-old New Yorker not only against banks that make up a major local industry but also potentially against business-friendly Democrats who have backed financial deregulation. Some moderate Democrats have privately raised concerns that they\u2019ll be targeted by the former bartender-turned-progressive icon, whose willingness to challenge her party\u2019s establishment propelled her to Congress and the national spotlight.\u201d\n\n-- Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s tactics are already creating friction with her Democratic colleagues. Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade and Heather Caygle report: \u201cSome lawmakers with ties to Ocasio-Cortez are hoping to coax her into using her star power to unite Democrats and turn her fire on Republicans. Others simultaneously warn Ocasio-Cortez is destined for a lonely, ineffectual career in Congress if she continues to treat her own party as the enemy. \u2026 Incumbent Democrats are most annoyed by Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s threat to back primary opponents against members of their ranks she deems too moderate.\u201d\n\n-- Former congressman Blake Farenthold, who left office amid sexual harassment allegations, resigned from his role as a lobbyist for the Calhoun Port Authority. The Victoria Advocate\u2019s Ciara McCarthy reports: \u201cFarenthold submitted his resignation to the port board in a letter dated Jan. 4, but it was announced by executive director Charles Hausmann during Thursday morning\u2019s board meeting. Board members did not comment about the resignation. Hausmann said only that Farenthold left \u2018to pursue other opportunities.\u2019 \u2026 The board hired Farenthold in May to be its first full-time legislative liaison at an annual salary of $160,000. After news of the hiring became public, the port endured intense local, state and national criticism for hiring a congressman who had stepped down amid an ethics investigation.\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH \u2014 THE SENATE EDITION:\n\n-- Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) once again apologized to staffers from his 2016 presidential campaign who said they were sexually harassed by co-workers. David Weigel and Felicia Sonmez report: \u201cOn Thursday morning, after Politico reported that Sanders\u2019s former Iowa campaign manager Robert Becker had been named in a $30,000 federal discrimination settlement with two former employees, Sanders told reporters that he thanked the women \u2018from the bottom of my heart for speaking out\u2019 and formally apologized to them. \u2026 Sanders said that his 2018 Senate reelection campaign in Vermont had operated under \u2018some of the strongest sexual harassment policies in the country\u2019 and that he had not been aware of the $30,000 settlement.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is considering basing her potential 2020 campaign in the small upstate city of Troy, N.Y. The AP\u2019s Juana Summers and Julie Pace report: \u201cThe search for a headquarters is the strongest signal yet that the New York senator will soon enter a presidential race that could ultimately draw dozens of candidates. The selection of Troy, 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Manhattan, could allow Gillibrand to highlight her roots in Upstate New York, where she was born and later represented in Congress before being appointed to the Senate.\u201d Gillibrand is planning a trip to Iowa next weekend as she seeks on-the-ground staffers there.\n\n-- Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) is also headed to Iowa in the coming weeks as his chief of staff ramps up preparations for a possible presidential campaign. Politico\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: \u201cGoing to Iowa would be the latest signal from Brown and his wife, Connie Schultz, that he is considering a White House run organized around the \u2018dignity of work,\u2019 the theme of his reelection campaign last year. But preparations go beyond public statements as Brown\u2019s longtime aide and current chief of staff, Sarah Benzing works backstage to set up a campaign \u2014 with a particular focus on Iowa, where she grew up and worked on a series of congressional, Senate and presidential efforts earlier in her career. \u2026 She has spent the weeks since Brown's reelection to the Senate \u2026 calling her Iowa network, seeking advice and operatives to staff a Brown presidential bid.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) is starting to craft her personal message on her book tour as she prepares for a likely 2020 announcement. From Chelsea Janes: \u201cIn her book and on her tour, Harris is introducing herself as a candidate of nuance, a child of immigrants, a woman of color, capable of bridging the cracks in the country\u2019s foundation because she has seen their effects firsthand. \u2026 But Harris was not only defining her racial identity this week but also her atypical path as a politician. She acknowledged questions might arise over her choice to become a prosecutor, as San Francisco district attorney and then as the state attorney general. \u2026 As she has for much of her career, she went out of her way to avoid alienating elements of the party.\u201d\n\nJustices of the U.S. Supreme Court sit for their official group photo. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE REST OF THE AGENDA:\n\n-- The West Wing is gearing up for another possible Supreme Court confirmation battle if Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s health takes a turn for the worse. Politico\u2019s Eliana Johnson and Gabby Orr report: \u201cThe outreach began after Ginsburg, 85, on Monday missed oral arguments at the court for the first time in her 25 years on the bench. \u2026 The White House \u2018is taking the temperature on possible short-list candidates, reaching out to key stakeholders, and just making sure that people are informed on the process,\u2019 said a source familiar with those conversations, who spoke on background given the delicate nature of the subject. \u2018They're doing it very quietly, of course, because the idea is not to be opportunistic, but just to be prepared so we aren't caught flat-footed.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The White House took the unusual step in 2017 of requesting a meeting with a senior DOJ official about a case involving casino magnate Steve Wynn, a top Trump donor. The Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein, Lachlan Markay and Betsy Woodruff report: Wynn \u201cwas embroiled in litigation involving Obama-era rules governing how companies could distribute tips gathered by their employees. Months after the meeting request, the Trump administration revised those rules to make them far friendlier to employers. \u2026 Top legal officials of past administrations said it was not uncommon for White House officials to meet with the solicitor general or top DoJ officials to discuss pending business before the courts. But the email still struck legal ethicists as problematic, as it showed the Trump White House eager to keep tabs on litigation directly affecting one of the president\u2019s highest-profile donors.\u201d\n\n-- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a speech in Cairo on the Middle East notable for its harsh criticism of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. The New York Times\u2019s Declan Walsh and David E. Sanger report: \u201cMr. Pompeo\u2019s prescription was short on specifics, beyond bolstering alliances with Arab autocrats loyal to Washington. Instead he painted a picture of a Middle East cast into chaos by [Obama], and that can only be rescued by crushing Iran. \u2026 In an unusually explicit and personal attack on a former president\u2019s foreign policy, a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech at another Cairo university, Mr. Pompeo excoriated Mr. Obama for \u2018fundamental misunderstandings\u2019 about the region that \u2018underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Some former diplomats and Middle East experts panned Pompeo\u2019s speech as \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d Gerald Feierstein, a former U.S. ambassador to Yemen, said the speech \u201cwas a regurgitation of what they have been saying for two years. \u2026 That they think that anyone still wants to hear about Barack Obama\u2019s 2009 Cairo speech \u2014 get over it. \u2026 People want to know what you are going to do, not what you think Barack Obama did wrong. And on that score, there was nothing there.\u201d (Al-Monitor)\n\n-- Pompeo also praised Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, who has been criticized by some as a military dictator, the same day that Trump disparaged Democratic leadership as worse than China\u2019s Communist Party bosses. The New York Times\u2019s Mark Landler reports: \u201c\u2018I find China, frankly, in many ways to be far more honorable than Cryin\u2019 Chuck and Nancy. I really do,\u2019 Mr. Trump said \u2026 \u2018China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.\u2019 \u2026 Mr. Trump\u2019s affinity for strongmen is well established, as is his contempt for his predecessor and his habit of gleefully ridiculing opponents, regardless of their party affiliation. But rarely has the Trump administration offered such a striking display of embracing autocrats as friends and painting those at home with whom it disagrees as enemies.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump reiterated his claim that Mexico would pay for the wall through a renegotiated trade deal that has not yet been approved by Congress, an assertion that has won Four Pinocchios from The Fact Checker:\n\nI often said during rallies, with little variation, that \u201cMexico will pay for the Wall.\u201d We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico.

The president vs. the presidency, cont.", "text": "With Joanie Greve\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Tweet first, ask questions later.\n\nThat\u2019s been President Trump\u2019s approach to a host of issues \u2014 think of the transgender troop ban \u2014 but perhaps nowhere more so than on Syria.\n\nSince his abrupt announcement three weeks ago that he was immediately pulling U.S. forces out of the country, the president has appeared to vacillate under pressure from hawkish Republicans. And his own top aides have contradicted him as they lay out conditions for withdrawal that create wiggle room to keep boots on the ground.\n\n\u201cI never said we're doing it that quickly, but we're decimating ISIS,\u201d Trump told reporters Sunday morning as he headed for Camp David. \u201cWith that being said, we're pulling out of Syria. But \u2026 we won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a big but. It\u2019s also at odds with Trump\u2019s initial announcement that the U.S. would depart within 30 days and that the Islamic State has been defeated, not \u201cdecimated.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, visiting Jerusalem to reassure Israeli leaders on Sunday, White House national security adviser John Bolton acknowledged that pockets of the Islamic State remain undefeated and argued that a quick pullout could endanger U.S. forces. He pledged that the Kurds in Syria would be protected and added that \u201cthe defense of Israel and other friends in the region is absolutely assured.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe timetable flows from the policy decisions that we need to implement,\u201d Bolton said during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n-- Two fresh data points from Sunday show that the Islamic State, while in retreat, has not been vanquished.\n\n1. A missile attack by the Islamic State wounded two British soldiers and killed at least one Kurdish fighter they were with in eastern Syria, per the AP. It\u2019s the first known casualty by coalition forces since Trump announced the pullout.\n\n2. \u201cKurdish forces in Syria said Sunday that they had captured two American citizens hiding out in the country\u2019s final Islamic State stronghold,\u201d per Louisa Loveluck and Erin Cunningham. \u201cIn a statement, the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, identified the detainees as Warren Christopher Clark, 34, and Zaid Abed al-Hamid, 35. \u2026 In a sign of how far some of the group\u2019s members had traveled as their battlefields shrank, the SDF said Sunday that Clark and Hamid had been captured hundreds of miles from Mosul, in the Hajin area of eastern Syria. \u2026 Clark was a Texas resident and worked as a substitute teacher in the Houston area before traveling to Saudi Arabia and Turkey to teach English \u2026 He reportedly converted to Islam in 2004 and later became radicalized online.\u201d\n\n-- Moreover, the U.S.-led coalition appears to have ramped up active military operations in the wake of Trump\u2019s announcement. \u201cBetween December 16 and December 29, US-led coalition military forces conducted 469 air and artillery strikes targeting ISIS in Syria,\u201d CNN reports. \u201cThe strikes were carried out against ISIS fighters, buildings, oil facilities, vehicles, tunnels, weapons caches and improvised explosive device facilities \u2026 Prior to that period the coalition had been averaging about 200 strikes per week in Syria as fighting around the ISIS-held town of Hajin ramped up.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAmong the policy decisions still to be made is what to do about the tens of thousands of Syrian Kurdish fighters that U.S. forces have trained, armed and advised to carry out the ground war against the Islamic State,\u201d Karen DeYoung and Karoun Demirjian report. \u201cWhile Trump has expressed confidence that Turkey, which controls its own Syrian force opposed to both the Kurds and to President Bashar al-Assad, is capable of picking up the remaining fight against the Islamic State, Pentagon and State Department officials question Turkish priorities and capabilities. \u2026 Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have stated repeatedly in recent months that driving Iran from Syria was also an objective for both the United States and Israel. But Trump appeared to indicate Sunday that both Iran and Russia, whose forces in Syria back Assad, were potential U.S. allies against the Islamic State.\u201d\n\n-- These are the kinds of significant questions that would typically be hashed out during an interagency process before a public announcement. A review of the timeline illustrates how erratic the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric has been:\n\nDec. 14: What triggered all this was a phone call from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. \u201cTrump was briefed before to warn the Turkish leader not to invade Syria, as he had been threatening to do,\u201d per David Ignatius. \u201cBut Trump instead told Erdogan: \u2018You know what? It\u2019s yours. I\u2019m leaving.\u2019\u201d\n\nDec. 19: Trump announces the withdrawal. \u201cOur boys, our young women, our men, they\u2019re all coming back, and they\u2019re coming back now,\u201d he said in a video posted to Twitter. \u201cWe won.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have defeated ISIS in Syria,\u201d Trump added, \u201cmy only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.\u201d\n\nDec. 20: Jim Mattis resigned as defense secretary during what one senior administration official described that day as a disagreement in the Oval Office, in which Mattis sought to persuade the president to stand down on the Syria withdrawal but was rejected.\n\n\u201cGetting out of Syria was no surprise,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. \u2026 Time to come home.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Trump had declared extemporaneously in March during a speech in Ohio: \u201cWe\u2019ll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now!\u201d Then he backed off in the face of resistance from aides and the brass \u2014 just like he might be doing again.\n\nDec. 24: Trump declared that \u201cSaudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States.\u201d The Saudis responded that they had not made any financial pledges since August, when the State Department announced that Riyadh had committed $100 million to a stabilization fund.\n\nDec. 26: Trump told reporters on Air Force One during his flight to Iraq that he would reject any request from generals to again extend his deadline for pulling out. \u201cThey said again, recently, \u2018Can we have more time?\u2019\u201d Trump said of U.S. generals. \u201cI said: \u2018Nope! You can\u2019t have any more time! You\u2019ve had enough time!\u2019 We\u2019ve knocked them out.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the troops, Trump criticized their commanders for failing to meet the previous deadlines he set. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer the suckers, folks,\u201d the president said.\n\nDec. 30: Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters after eating lunch with Trump at the White House that the president reassured him the Syria decision was more of a \u201cpause situation\u201d than a withdrawal.\n\nThe President will make sure any withdrawal from Syria will be done in a fashion to ensure:\n\n\n\n1) ISIS is permanently destroyed.\n\n\n\n2) Iran doesn\u2019t fill in the back end, and\n\n\n\n3) our Kurdish allies are protected. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 30, 2018\n\nDec. 31: \u201cISIS is mostly gone,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019re slowly sending our troops back home.\u201d\n\nJan. 3: Trump said during a Cabinet meeting that Iran\u2019s leadership \u201ccan do what they want\u201d in Syria.\n\nJan. 4: In response to reports that Trump extended his deadline for pulling out from 30 days to four months, one of four senior administration officials speaking to reporters during a background briefing said, \u201cWe have no timeline for our forces to withdraw from Syria.\u201d\n\n-- All these recalibrations have underscored just how rash that initial announcement was. Trump\u2019s words pack less of a punch when allies and adversaries alike take them less seriously. President Barack Obama also learned this the hard way when he said Assad using chemical weapons would be a \u201cred line\u201d and then didn\u2019t forcefully respond when he did.\n\n-- Cleanup on Aisle Nine: Senior administration officials are fanning out across the Middle East this week on a handholding mission to reassure anxious allies. Bolton will visit Turkey on Tuesday. Pompeo has stops scheduled in eight countries: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Jordan.\n\n-- For his part, Trump continues to insist on unflinching loyalty. The chief of staff at the Pentagon has been forced out of his post because of White House concerns about his close ties to Mattis, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Gordon Lubold reports: \u201cThe Pentagon announced that Kevin Sweeney, a retired Navy rear admiral who had worked closely with Mr. Mattis, had stepped down. \u2026 Mr. Sweeney had worked alongside Mr. Mattis at several points during his career, including when Mr. Mattis was still in uniform \u2026 The bond was a source of concern to the White House, the U.S. officials said, adding the appointment of Pat Shanahan as acting secretary by [Trump] last month was seen as an opportunity to remove Mr. Sweeney. \u2026\n\n\u201cMr. Sweeney had expressed a desire to stay on at the Pentagon as recently as last week,\u201d per the Journal. \u201cSome officials believed he would provide continuity during the transition from Mr. Mattis to Mr. Shanahan. But, under pressure from the White House, Mr. Shanahan informed Mr. Sweeney on Friday that he was removing him as chief of staff Friday.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d and \u201cGreen Book\u201d took home surprise honors at a Golden Globes ceremony marked by a Hollywood consensus on the need for industry change, television critic Hank Stuever reports. \u201cThe stars are bored. It\u2019s their own fault, really, and it\u2019s mostly a good thing: They\u2019re woke and on board with Hollywood\u2019s attempts at a corrective course on diversity and equal rights, which is why Sunday night\u2019s telecast of the 76th annual Golden Globe Awards on NBC lacked the boozy, loosey-goosey tension of its renowned past. But is that really such a sacrifice, in exchange for solidarity? This was a by-the-book but overlong awards show, gentle on the jokes and heavy on the adulation.\n\n\u201cIn the film categories, big winners of the evening included the surprise choice of the Freddie Mercury biopic \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019 (for best drama); \u2018Green Book\u2019 (best musical or comedy); lead acting (drama) awards for Rami Malek (\u2018Bohemian Rhapsody\u2019) and an utterly surprised Glenn Close (\u2018The Wife\u2019); and \u2018Roma,\u2019 which won best foreign language film and best director (Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n). In the television categories, Golden Globes went to FX\u2019s \u2018The Americans\u2019 (best drama, at long last); Netflix\u2019s \u2018The Kominsky Method\u2019 (best comedy, a very Golden Globes-kind of choice); and FX\u2019s \u2018The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u2019 (best limited series).\u201d Here is the full list of winners.\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nA man was charged in the fatal shooting of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes. The killing of Jazmine last week in Houston set off a manhunt amid speculation that it was racially motivated. But authorities said they believe Barnes may have been shot at \u201cas a result of mistaken identity.\u201d (Michael Brice-Saddler) A Saudi woman who fled to Bangkok in the hope of seeking asylum in Australia will not be immediately deported. Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, 18, said she escaped from her family because she feared for her life and is now demanding a meeting with the U.N.'s refugee agency. \u201cIf deporting her would result in her death, we definitely wouldn\u2019t want to do that,\u201d the head of Thailand\u2019s immigration bureau said. (Shibani Mahtani) A Christian ministry in South Carolina is requesting an exemption from the Trump administration to continue imposing a Christians-only rule for its foster-care program. The ministry\u2019s policy violates a regulation put in place during the final days of the Obama administration, which bars religious discrimination for the federally funded program. (Laura Meckler) Producer Susan Zirinsky will become the first woman to lead CBS News. She will replace David Rhodes, who has held the job since 2011 and is nearing the end of his contract. (LA Times) The Philadelphia Eagles advanced to the divisional round of the NFL playoffs after defeating the Chicago Bears. The Los Angeles Chargers also beat the Baltimore Ravens in their wild-card matchup. (Adam Kilgore) A group of soldiers in Gabon staged a failed coup attempt against the central African country\u2019s absent president. Just hours after they seized control of the national broadcaster, four of the five soldiers had been arrested, according to a government spokesman. (Max Bearak) Belgium has banned ritual slaughters of animals. The move, which went into effect on New Year\u2019s Day, was praised by animal rights advocates and right-wing nationalists, but religious minorities fear they are the target of legal bigotry. (New York Times) A dispute between dog walkers in a Philadelphia park resulted in a fatal injury. Police say the victim asked another man not to let his dog run around without a leash. The man punched the victim, who fell to the ground and hit his head. He was later pronounced dead at the hospital. (AP)\n\nSHUTDOWN LATEST:\n\n-- The Trump administration and Democratic leaders are still at an impasse over the border wall \u2014 signaling an indefinite continuation of the partial government shutdown that is now in its third week. Robert Costa, Juliet Eilperin, Damian Paletta and Nick Miroff report: \u201cAs agencies sought to deal with cascading problems across the federal bureaucracy, acting White House budget director Russell T. Vought sent congressional leaders a letter detailing the administration\u2019s latest offer to end the shutdown. It demanded $5.7 billion \u2018for construction of a steel barrier for the Southwest border\u2019 but also proposed \u2018an additional $800 million to address urgent humanitarian needs\u2019 and unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the border. The administration has also signaled it would be willing to restore some version of an Obama-era program that allowed children in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to apply for refugee resettlement in the United States ...\n\n\u201cBut a border wall is \u2018central to any strategy,\u2019 Vought wrote, and Democrats \u2014 who have said the wall should not be tied to an agreement to reopen the government \u2014 remained skeptical of any overtures by the president, suggesting that there is no end in sight to the shutdown, which has entered its third week. A Democratic official familiar with the meeting said no progress was made over the weekend, in large part because the White House hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about how the money would be used or why the request is for so much more than the administration sought only a few months ago.\u201d\n\n-- Trump reiterated his threat to declare a national emergency to fund a border wall. Robert Costa, Felicia Sonmez and Nick Miroff report: \u201cTrump also said Sunday that he understood the predicament facing hundreds of thousands of federal workers who are not receiving their paychecks. \u2018I can relate, and I\u2019m sure the people who are on the receiving end will make adjustments; they always do,\u2019 Trump said. He claimed that \u2018many of those people agree with what I\u2019m doing\u2019: refusing to reopen the government without obtaining funding for his long-promised border wall. And he further backed away from the notion of a concrete wall, telling reporters that he has informed his staff to now say \u2018steel barrier.\u2019 \u201d\n\n-- White House officials have been looking into the possibility of declaring a national emergency at the border for weeks now, according to Bloomberg News\u2019s Justin Sink and Jennifer Jacobs. \u201cSome advisers close to Trump are recommending that he declare a national emergency, despite wide recognition that it would be immediately challenged in court. \u2026 But Trump\u2019s consideration of such an extraordinary step indicates that some in the White House see the gambit as the president\u2019s lone way to salvage his wall pledge as the consequences of the shutdown begin to amplify and talks with Democrats fall flat.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s press secretary left open the possibility of declaring a national emergency in a Fox News interview. From Politico\u2019s Victoria Guida: \u201c[Sarah] Sanders said Trump \u2018is prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders to protect the people of this country.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019re looking at exploring every option available that the president has,\u2019 she said. \u2018Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful.\u2019 She also argued that the president isn\u2019t \u2018holding anybody hostage\u2019 by not signing legislation that would fund government agencies other than the Department of Homeland Security. \u2018He knows it\u2019s better if they can focus on getting all these packages done at once,\u2019 Sanders said.\u201d\n\n-- Republican Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), who is up for reelection next year, said the Senate should vote on the funding bills passed in the House. From the Hill\u2019s Brett Samuels: \u201cCollins said on NBC's \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 that she understands [Mitch McConnell] is in a difficult spot because the president may not sign bills passed by the Democratic-held House, but pressed for a vote to reopen agencies like Agriculture, Interior, Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. \u2018I\u2019m frustrated in the situation that we\u2019ve gotten to this point where both sides appear to be intransigent,\u2019 Collins said. \u2018It is not a sign of weakness to figure out a middle ground. I think that both sides need to indicate a willingness to listen and to compromise.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Meanwhile, the effects of the shutdown are mounting. From Costa, Eilperin, Paletta and Miroff: \u201cThe Department of Housing and Urban Development sent letters to 1,500 landlords Friday as part of a last-minute effort to prevent the eviction of thousands of tenants. A lot of those tenants live in units covered by a HUD program that many agency officials didn\u2019t realize had expired on Jan. 1 and that they are now unable to renew. \u2026 Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service officials are trying to determine whether they will be able to pay tax refunds next month, despite the fact that they said last year they would be prohibited from doing so in the event of a government shutdown.\u201d\n\n-- The National Park Service has decided to use entrance fees to pay for expanded operations at popular sites, an unprecedented step that some call illegal. Juliet Eilperin reports: \u201cUnder a memorandum signed Saturday by the Interior Department\u2019s acting secretary, David Bernhardt ... park managers will be permitted to bring on additional staff to clean restrooms, haul trash, patrol the parks and open areas that have been shut during the more-than-two-week budget impasse. In a statement Sunday, National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith acknowledged that the administration\u2019s practice of keeping parks open but understaffed has become unsustainable at some of its most beloved sites. \u2026 Congressional Democrats and some park advocates question whether the park-fee move is legal, because the fees that parks collect under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act are expressly designated to support visitor services instead of operations and basic maintenance.\u201d\n\n-- Small towns with federal workers are seeing the strain on local businesses. Heather May, Annie Gowen and Joel Achenbach report: \u201cMany of the affected federal workers \u2014 including 10,000 people in Utah, 6,200 in West Virginia and 5,500 in Alabama \u2014 have salaries far below the average $85,000 for government employees. But those paychecks drive local economies, and workers are starting to make tough choices about how to spend them \u2014 eating out less, limiting travel and shopping at food pantries instead of grocery stores \u2014 creating a ripple effect through the neighborhoods and towns where they live.\u201d\n\n-- Millions of food-stamp recipients could have their benefits disrupted if the shutdown drags past January. CBS News\u2019s Grace Segers reports: \u201cThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP at the federal level, is one of the agencies unfunded during the partial government shutdown. Although SNAP is automatically renewed, it has not been allocated funding from Congress beyond January. Congress has appropriated $3 billion in emergency funds for SNAP distribution, but that would not cover all of February's obligations.\u201d\n\n-- Some federal prison employees expressed frustration about serving meals of steak and Cornish hen to inmates as they work without pay. Cleve R. Wootson Jr. reports: \u201cFor inmates at [Florida\u2019s Coleman Federal Correctional Complex], New Year\u2019s Day lunch was grilled steak, steamed rice with gravy, black-eyed peas, green beans, macaroni and cheese, a choice of garlic biscuits or whole wheat bread and an assortment of holiday pies. The feast was served by not-particularly-festive prison guards and workers who have no idea when they will receive their next paycheck \u2014 but who have to come to work anyway because they work in crucial public safety jobs.\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Joe Biden is nearing a final decision on a 2020 presidential run. The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: \u201c[Biden] has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat [Trump], an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination. \u2026 Yet Mr. Biden\u2019s skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. \u2026 More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden\u2019s possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. \u2026 But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) zeroed in on her 2020 message during an Iowa visit as she conspicuously avoided using Trump\u2019s name. Annie Linskey and Chelsea Janes report: \u201cShe aimed directly at voters tempted by [Trump\u2019s] angry populism in 2016 but avoided mentions of Trump himself almost entirely. \u2026 For Warren, virtually every position she advocated was, in policy terms, a repudiation of the president and the course he has set for the nation in his first two years. That was true from specifics \u2014 her demand that presidential candidates release their taxes, which the president has refused to do \u2014 to the generic \u2014 her repeated lament that the middle class has been hollowed out as economic and political fairness has been lost.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cTrump has become the silence between the notes of Warren's speeches, which portray an economic system that has been rigged, for decades, to favor the wealthy,\u201d David Weigel writes. \u201cWhen Warren talks about the fights she's been through, she focuses on the \u2018million dollars a day\u2019 that bank lobbyists spent, unsuccessfully, to stop the creation of the financial-industry regulatory agency she proposed and initially ran, and on her evisceration of former Wells Fargo chief executive John Stumpf, which was a factor in his resignation. It's a return to the rhetoric that worked so well for her in 2012, affirming her status as an icon of the left.\u201d\n\n-- In a blog Warren wrote between 2005 and 2008, the then-Harvard law professor criticized Biden for a vote he cast in the Senate. NBC News\u2019s Jack Bohrer reports: \u201cIn March of 2006, Warren wrote that Biden's 2005 vote in favor of the bankruptcy bill that spurred her foray into blogging made him part of \u2018a bi-partisan coalition to prefer powerful corporation [sic] over hard-working families.\u2019 \u2018For years, Senator Joe Biden vied with Republican Senators Charles Grassley and [Orrin] Hatch for head cheerleader for this bill,\u2019 Warren wrote. \u2018Even as he tried to position his national image as a strong supporter of women, Senator Biden was twisting arms to get the bankruptcy bill through Congress.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Warren\u2019s Senate colleagues are not jumping to endorse her \u2014 or any of her prospective challengers. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett reports: \u201cEven Sen. Ed Markey isn\u2019t ready to endorse his fellow Massachusetts Democrat, at least not yet. \u2018When she is moving forward, we\u2019re going to be talking,\u2019 Markey said as he prepared for Warren\u2019s swearing in to another term in the Senate. \u2018I\u2019ve just got to get today done.\u2019 Warren\u2019s hard-edged brand of progressive politics has annoyed some of her colleagues at times, but the lack of support from her caucus isn\u2019t personal. With a wide open Democratic primary, including perhaps a half-dozen of Warren\u2019s own colleagues set to join the race, there\u2019s no sense in getting out ahead of anyone, according to a dozen Democratic senators from across the ideological spectrum.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s campaign is devoting extensive resources to ensure the 2020 Republican convention is a smooth advertisement for his reelection. Politico\u2019s Alex Isenstadt reports: \u201cThe president\u2019s reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. \u2026 For Trump adversaries, the possibilities for mischief in Charlotte would be endless. They could attempt headline-grabbing floor protests, demand prime-time speaking slots for presidential detractors, or even wage a long-shot bid to nominate someone else. The campaign is so focused on ensuring the convention is a smooth-running affair devoid of presidential critics that it\u2019s building out an entire wing of the campaign devoted solely to the endeavor. The initiative appears to be unique in both how early it's been launched and how far-reaching it is.\u201d\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- Trump tweeted that the al-Qaeda operative accused of organizing the 2000 bombing on the USS Cole, Jamal al-Badawi, was killed in a U.S. airstrike. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cU.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the Middle East, confirmed Badawi\u2019s death Sunday afternoon. \u2026 Seventeen American sailors were killed and more than 40 were injured in the Oct. 12, 2000, attack, in which al-Qaeda suicide bombers pulled up to the refueling destroyer in an explosives-laden boat and blasted a hole in its hull.\u201d\n\n-- With Trump seemingly offering to play the role of mediator, Serbia and Kosovo appear to inching closer to peace talks. Anne Gearan reports: \u201cKosovo President Hashim Thaci made a previously unreported diplomatic trip to Berlin last month, where he met with U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump confidant. Thaci pledged then that he would reverse course on punitive tariffs imposed on all Serb goods. \u2026 Serbia has never recognized Kosovo\u2019s independence and has warned of an armed intervention over the latest disagreements. \u2026 Trump sent personal letters to the leaders of both countries last month, urging them to return to peace talks and offering the possibility of a joint White House invitation.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s trade war is increasingly disrupting U.S. factory operations as more firms contemplate moving elsewhere. The New York Times\u2019s Peter S. Goodman reports: \u201cIn the United States, factories that buy steel and aluminum \u2014 now more expensive \u2014 are struggling to pass on extra costs to their customers. Some are losing orders to overseas competitors that can buy metal free of American tariffs. Companies that import electronics and other parts are scrambling to remain profitable while exploring alternatives, such as moving plants beyond reach of the duties. \u2026 The tariffs have been sold to Americans as a means of forcing multinational companies to make their products in the United States, abandoning China, Mexico and other low-cost centers of industry. But the tariffs are threatening jobs that are already here.\u201d\n\n-- A South Korean newspaper reported that Trump and Kim Jong Un may meet in Hanoi for a second nuclear summit. From Bloomberg News\u2019s Jihye Lee: \u201cU.S. officials have met their North Korean counterparts in Hanoi for discussions to adjust scheduling for the talks, [the South Korean newspaper Munhwa Ilbo] said, citing high-level diplomatic sources in Seoul and Washington it did not identify. \u2026 Vietnam is a long-standing ally of Pyongyang that has good relations with Washington. Speculation about the country\u2019s prospects as a summit site grew following North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho\u2019s visit there from Nov. 29-Dec. 2.\u201d\n\n-- A top royal adviser Saudi officials have named as a key suspect in the killing of Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi has dropped out of sight. Kareem Fahim reports: \u201cSo in the seven weeks since [Saud al-Qahtani] was placed under investigation, only rumors have filled the silence. He was spotted recently in the coastal city of Jiddah, a resident said, and in the offices of the royal court here in the capital, according to a person who works with the government. Other accounts put Qahtani, once a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in a remote corner of the kingdom, laying low. The government\u2019s treatment of Qahtani is being closely watched in Washington and other foreign capitals as a test of whether Saudi Arabia is sincere about prosecuting everyone found to be involved in Khashoggi\u2019s killing, including senior officials.\u201d\n\n-- Scientists say the high-pitched noise that diplomats in Havana complained about before displaying mysterious neurological symptoms may have been caused by one of the region\u2019s insects. The Guardian\u2019s Ian Sample reports: \u201c[A] fresh analysis of the audio recording has revealed what scientists in the UK and the US now believe is the true source of the piercing din: it is the song of the Indies short-tailed cricket, known formally as Anurogryllus celerinictus. \u2026 The identification of the sound source does not mean that an attack of some sort did not happen, but it casts doubt over the sound being responsible for the diplomats\u2019 health problems.\u201d\n\n-- British Prime Minister Theresa May urged Parliament members to back her Brexit deal when it comes up for another vote this month. Politico\u2019s Laura Kayali reports: \u201cShe refused to rule out repeated votes on the same deal if she loses the first time round. \u2026 \u2018Don\u2019t let the search for the perfect Brexit be the enemy of the good,\u2019 May said, a reference to the criticisms of hard-line Brexiteers and EU supporters such as former European Commissioner Peter Mandelson, who argue the deal undermines British sovereignty and should be rejected. \u2026 May slammed MPs asking for a second referendum. \u2018It would divide our country and we wouldn\u2019t be able to organize a referendum before March 29 [when Brexit will take effect],\u2019 she said, pointing out it would therefore require an extension of Article 50 (the treaty article allowing withdrawals from the EU).\u201d\n\n-- If Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, it could reverberate across other E.U. countries, including the Netherlands. Michael Birnbaum reports: \u201cThe Netherlands \u2014 Britain\u2019s main trading partner on mainland Europe \u2014 is among the most-prepared for the possibility that Britons will leave the E.U. on March 29 without a deal to manage the withdrawal. Leaders here fear that the best efforts of a nation that loves to be prepared may not be enough to safeguard against the mess. And Britain\u2019s other trading partnerships in Europe could be even worse off. \u2026 Irish lawmakers may have to set aside all other business this month to pass 45 pieces of emergency legislation aimed at mitigating the impact of Brexit. France is building roads, warehouses and checkpoints near its ports in preparation for new customs controls.\u201d\n\nSen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) walks to the Senate chamber for a vote last month. (Erik S. Lesser/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Democratic operatives with ties to a disinformation campaign in last year\u2019s Alabama Senate race, which was inspired by Russian tactics, are attempting to distance themselves from the effort. Craig Timberg, Tony Romm, Aaron C. Davis and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: \u201cRecent revelations about Project Birmingham \u2026 have shocked Democrats in Alabama and Washington. And news of the effort has underscored the warnings of disinformation experts who long have said that threats to honest, transparent political discourse in the age of social media are as likely to be domestic as foreign. \u2026 But all those who have acknowledged playing a role in Project Birmingham have denied knowing the full extent of the activities described in [a document on the operation]. Project Birmingham got its funding from Internet billionaire Reid Hoffman, who emerged as a leading underwriter of Democratic causes after the 2016 election. While acknowledging his money ended up paying for Project Birmingham, Hoffman said he did not know how his funds were used until details began to emerge in the New York Times and The Post.\u201d\n\n-- One Facebook page tied to the disinformation campaign impersonated Baptist prohibitionists who allegedly supported Republican Roy Moore\u2019s candidacy. The New York Times\u2019s Scott Shane and Alan Blinder report: \u201cThe \u2018Dry Alabama\u2019 Facebook page, illustrated with stark images of car wrecks and videos of families ruined by drink, had a blunt message: Alcohol is the devil\u2019s work, and the state should ban it entirely.

That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller\u2019s probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. \u2018If and when the time comes for impeachment,\u2019 she said, \u2018it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way.\u2019 Pelosi\u2019s remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H.

Who wasn\u2019t?

But his standoff with congressional Democrats doesn\u2019t appear to be headed to a resolution anytime soon.\n\nOn Saturday, in remarks billed as a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d on the border and the shutdown, Trump proposed a deal to Democrats. He continues to insist that any bill to reopen the government include billions of dollars for a physical barrier on the US-Mexico border \u2014 a \u201cwall\u201d \u2014 but is now open to such a bill including other immigration provisions as well.\n\nMost notably, he\u2019s open to extending existing protections for the 700,000 or so immigrants currently protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who currently have legal status under Temporary Protected Status. The Trump administration has moved to sunset DACA, and to end protections for most of the immigrants covered under TPS. Both of those plans are currently held up in litigation.\n\nDemocrats aren\u2019t particularly interested in what Trump\u2019s proposing. \u201cDemocrats were not consulted on this and have rejected similar overtures previously,\u201d a Democratic aide told Vox. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly a non-serious product of negotiations amongst White House staff to try to clean up messes the president created in the first place. POTUS is holding more people hostage for his wall.\u201d\n\nAfter weeks of all-or-nothing intransigence, Trump\u2019s announcement Saturday indicates that the White House realizes they\u2019re losing the shutdown in the eyes of most Americans, and are willing to compromise to reopen the government. But Democrats also know the White House is losing the shutdown, and the compromise now on offer is something they are unlikely to take.\n\nWhat Trump\u2019s offering: $5.7 billion for the wall in exchange for extensions of existing protections for some immigrants\n\nTrump\u2019s pitching this as a compromise: He wants the wall, Democrats want to help DACA and TPS recipients. But the deal isn\u2019t the result of conversations with Democrats. It\u2019s reportedly the result of discussions that Vice President Mike Pence and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner have had with congressional Republicans (most notably Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)).\n\nAnd it shows. What Trump\u2019s offering \u2014 temporary extensions of existing protections for both groups of immigrants \u2014 isn\u2019t something that Democrats have been wildly enthusiastic about in the past. Furthermore, with Trump\u2019s efforts to strip existing protections held up in court, it\u2019s essentially a short extension of the status quo.\n\nDACA recipients are currently being allowed to extend their protections for two years, just as they could under the Obama administration, while the administration fights in court to end the program. (People who don\u2019t already have protections are no longer allowed to apply.) Without knowing when the Supreme Court will rule \u2014 or how the Trump administration will proceed if the Supreme Court agrees they can end DACA, since their original plan (issuing no renewals for expirations after March 2018) is obviously moot \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say for sure that a three-year one-time extension will protect DACA recipients for longer than waiting for the Supreme Court.\n\nHere\u2019s what he offered Saturday:\n\n$5.7 billion in funding for a physical barrier on the US-Mexico border. Trump\u2019s not budging on this. The White House has already \u201cconceded\u201d that the barrier will be made of steel poles \u2014 which is what experts and border agents wanted anyway \u2014 rather than solid concrete. Per a letter sent earlier this month, the administration could build 243 miles of barriers with the $5.7 billion it\u2019s requesting, most of which would be built in the Rio Grande Valley.\u2019\n\nTrump\u2019s not budging on this.

On DACA, Trump is embracing a version of Graham\u2019s BRIDGE Act, which would extend DACA recipients\u2019 existing deportation protections and work permits for three more years. (The original BRIDGE Act applied also to immigrants who were eligible for DACA but not currently protected.) In theory, Congress would use that time to work out a permanent solution for DREAMers; but the last time the White House tried that, by giving Congress six months to address DACA before sunsetting it entirely, the gambit did not succeed. During that debate in late 2017 and early 2018, many Republicans gravitated toward bills that would offer DREAMers access to permanent legal status and ultimately to citizenship \u2014 a more moderate approach than what Trump is offering now.\n\nOn DACA, Trump is embracing a version of Graham\u2019s BRIDGE Act, which would extend DACA recipients\u2019 existing deportation protections and work permits for three more years.

A three-year extension of protections for TPS holders. Trump is also offering to extend ( for three years as well) the legal protections that hundreds of thousands of immigrants have under the Temporary Protected Status program \u2014 which is supposed to allow people to stay in the US while their countries recover from war or natural disasters, but which, over the years, has allowed many people to stay and put down roots in the US. TPS, unlike DACA, grants official legal status, but it doesn\u2019t offer any way to apply for a green card or citizenship. Trump\u2019s efforts to end TPS for most countries are held up in a different court fight \u2014 so this proposal, like the DACA proposal, would essentially be a legislative extension of the current judicially-imposed status quo.\n\nTrump is also offering to extend ( for three years as well) the legal protections that hundreds of thousands of immigrants have under the Temporary Protected Status program \u2014 which is supposed to allow people to stay in the US while their countries recover from war or natural disasters, but which, over the years, has allowed many people to stay and put down roots in the US.

The rest of Trump\u2019s proposal is a modified version of what the White House originally floated to Democrats in negotiations two weeks ago, codified in a letter sent by the Office of Management and Budget. Those demands include $800 million to deal with the actually-urgent humanitarian crisis at the US/Mexico border \u2014 the fact that unprecedented numbers of children and families are coming to the US (often to seek asylum) and border agents aren\u2019t equipped to deal with them. Trump\u2019s also demanding 2,750 more border agents and other law enforcement officials; millions of dollars in screening technology to detect drugs at ports of entry; and the hiring of 75 new immigration judges to address the immigration-court backlog, which is currently the biggest barrier to deporting people quickly (and which the current shutdown has exacerbated).\n\nThe rest of Trump\u2019s proposal is a modified version of what the White House originally floated to Democrats in negotiations two weeks ago, codified in a letter sent by the Office of Management and Budget.

Modest changes to asylum for Central American children and teenagers. The Trump administration is floating allowing Central American children and teenagers to apply for asylum in their home countries \u2014 a modification of an Obama-administration program Trump ended in 2017. In return, they want to change current law to eliminate automatic court hearings for children and teens who come to the US from Central America and other countries \u2014 making it much easier to summarily deport them.\n\nTrump is in a weakening position on the shutdown \u2014 and on immigration\n\nTrump could have proposed this deal at any time since before the government shut down; Graham has been pushing it for weeks. But as recently as Wednesday, Trump was telling reporters that he was waiting for Democrats to come back to the table to negotiate. And as recently as last week, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that the president was firmly opposed, in particular, to any wall deal that addressed the DACA issue.\n\nOn both of those questions \u2014 whether to offer Democrats a compromise to end the shutdown, and whether that compromise could include some protection for DACA recipients \u2014 the White House\u2019s political calculus has changed.\n\nOver the last week or so, the real-life consequences of the shutdown for the 800,000 federal employees currently going without pay have started becoming apparent. Affected workers missed their first paycheck on Friday, January 11; if nothing changes, they\u2019re set to miss another paycheck on Friday, January 25. (The president has signed a bill to give back pay to workers, but only after the shutdown ends.) And with the Senate out of session for the next week (though they could be called back for votes on 24 hours\u2019 notice), it looks like that second missed paycheck is a foregone conclusion.\n\nReports from inside the White House indicate that Trump advisers have gotten increasingly anxious to end the shutdown. One administration official told the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Natalie Andrews and Michael C. Bender on Wednesday that advisers have warned Trump \u201cthis isn\u2019t just a messaging war\u201d and that he\u2019s \u201cplaying with live ammunition\u201d \u2014 with the implication that the president is taking the blame for the shutdown\u2019s real-life casualties.\n\nThe White House\u2019s sudden willingness to include DACA in shutdown talks, meanwhile, might stem from something that happened Friday \u2014 or rather, didn\u2019t happen.\n\nObservers on all sides have assumed that the Supreme Court was going to take up the lawsuit against Trump\u2019s efforts to end DACA this term, and would rule (probably in the Trump administration\u2019s favor) in June. But as of yesterday \u2014 the court\u2019s traditional deadline for adopting cases for the current term \u2014 the Supreme Court hadn\u2019t officially agreed to hear the DACA case.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the court will announce in the coming days that it\u2019s hearing the DACA case after all, and can squeeze it in. But the fact that they haven\u2019t done it already makes it seem very plausible that they\u2019re going to wait until the new term starts in October. That means DACA, in its current form, would remain alive for months \u2014 and possibly until June 2020.\n\nThat undermines Trump\u2019s boasts that the Supreme Court is going to rule in his favor on DACA. If the White House was expecting to be able to pressure Democrats to accept a more conservative immigration deal in June, because they were worried about DREAMers\u2019 protections expiring imminently, the administration may now be reconsidering.\n\nThe problem for the White House is that Democrats also know all this. They know that if they don\u2019t make a deal, current DACA recipients will remain protected from deportation and able to work for several more months at least. So there\u2019s less incentive for them to agree to any compromise \u2014 especially one that offers to extend the same protections DACA recipients have now for just a few years, instead of offering them permanent legal status or access to citizenship.\n\nWhy Democrats probably won\u2019t be tempted by Trump\u2019s offer\n\nThere are three big reasons \u2014 above and beyond the fact that Democrats know they have the upper hand on timing \u2014 why this deal is unlikely to appeal to them.\n\nAll you have to do is listen to what Democratic leaders have been saying so far.\n\n1) Most obviously, the deal\u2019s a non-starter because it still calls for money to fund a border wall. After all, Trump\u2019s unflinching demand for wall money \u2014 and Democrats\u2019 refusal to approve it \u2014 is the main reason the government is shutdown in the first place.\n\nWeek after week, Democrats have signaled that there\u2019s little room for negotiation on this issue. In Democratic leaders last meeting with Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi went so far as to say she wouldn\u2019t agree to fund such a structure even after the government is opened. \u201cThe fact is, a wall is an immorality,\u201d she said at a recent press appearance. \u201cIt\u2019s not who we are as a nation.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats are open to providing more money for border security \u2014 allocations that would cover fencing and technology along the southern border \u2014 any deal referencing a wall, or something like it, would be a very tough pill to swallow even if it guarantees them some policy wins.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Tara Golshan has explained, Democrats are vehemently opposed to a border wall not necessarily because they oppose physical barriers along the border, but because backing it would be seen as the equivalent of backing one of Trump\u2019s racist campaign promises.\n\n2) Thus far, Democrats have refused to negotiate on border security until the government is reopened. They\u2019ve asked Trump to end the shutdown first and then they\u2019ll talk.\n\n\u201cWe Democrats are exasperated. All we want to do is reopen the government,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said during floor remarks this week. \u201cWe are happy to debate border security with the president and our Republican colleagues. Happy to. But let\u2019s reopen the government.\u201d\n\nIf Democrats adhere to this stance, Trump\u2019s proposal wouldn\u2019t even be up for discussion until the shutdown ends, rendering it a moot point. As of Saturday afternoon, Democratic leadership has given no sign that they are budging from their position. In fact, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin reaffirmed it.\n\n3) Democrats have a lot of trust issues with Trump when it comes to any kind of DACA deal. That also throws their willingness to consider this proposal further into doubt.\n\nMuch of this distrust stems from a similar effort to negotiate on DACA almost exactly a year ago, when Schumer offered Trump more than $20 billion in border wall funding in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients. At the time, Trump actually appeared open to the proposal and Schumer was optimistic, MSNBC reported.\n\nJust hours after the meeting where they purportedly reached an agreement, however, Trump reneged because the plan wasn\u2019t conservative enough, and ultimately urged Congress to consider another proposal that had far more stringent restrictions on legal immigration. Trump has since shut down numerous other efforts to codify DACA protections as well.\n\nSchumer was heavily criticized by liberal activists for his concessions on wall funding last January, an offer he wound up retracting, and it\u2019s unlikely he and Pelosi would be willing to take on that kind of heat unless they were certain a deal would not only be guaranteed, but also ensure that Democrats walk away with other significant victories.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we offered last time and the President reneged on his offer,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray, the third-ranking member in the Democratic Senate conference, told Vox last week, when asked about the possibility of a trade that includes wall money and a permanent path to citizenship for DACA recipients. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what he wants.\u201d\n\nWhere talks could go from here\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to offer up an explicit proposal does put some pressure on Democrats, who\u2019ve thus far been rejecting a more theoretical suggestion of a DACA deal. His announcement doesn\u2019t necessarily push them to accept this specific deal, but it is meant to create the impression that the president is trying to negotiate, putting some onus on Democrats to respond.\n\nThey seem ready to. Earlier on Saturday, The New York Times\u2019s Julie Hirschfield Davis reported that Democrats had plans of offering a concession of their own. In the coming week, House Democrats intend to pass a spending bill that will include an additional $1 billion to address border-security needs, like improving infrastructure at ports of entry and hiring immigration judges.\n\nAs The New York Times\u2019s Maggie Haberman reported, White House officials think Trump\u2019s new proposal could potentially pass the Senate, presumably with the help of moderate Democrats. Currently, Republicans, who have a 53-47 majority in the upper chamber, would need seven Democrats to join them to advance it. As Trump noted in his speech, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell intends to bring the proposal to a floor vote this week, a somewhat confusing move since McConnell has said he isn\u2019t interested in taking votes on spending bills that don\u2019t have the support to pass.\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely that enough Democrats would be willing to peel off from their caucus in support of wall funding, though some have been open to it in the past. Ahead of the midterms, a subset of vulnerable red-state Democrats including Sens. Joe Manchin and Jon Tester said they would back Trump\u2019s border wall and other lawmakers have previously supported a DACA trade for border security.\n\nAt the same time, Trump\u2019s willingness to allow any form of relief for DACA recipients is producing a backlash from the conservative influencers who Trump usually trusts to speak for his \u201cbase\u201d:\n\nTrump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb! \u2014 Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) January 19, 2019\n\nTrump has a history of backing out of immigration compromises once he feels the heat from his base. It\u2019s not clear whether that will happen now that he\u2019s committed to this deal in a \u201cmajor announcement.\u201d But it\u2019s also not clear how the deal will lead to an end to the shutdown if, instead of building support for the proposal, the White House is losing it.", "stance": "L", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2019/1/19/18189549/trump-shutdown-announcement-deal-daca-democrats", "imageUrl": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/639ELWZ5PIz1ewnI_lExZOAuwCo=/0x0:3480x1822/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13701721/1083976976.jpg.jpg", "datePublished": "2019-01-19T20:53:52Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Market Commentary: Issues 2019", "author": "Doug Noland", "source": "Seekingalpha.com", "summary": "The S&P 500 jumped 2.5% (up 3.6% y-t-d), and the Dow rose 2.4% (up 2.9%). Three-month Treasury bill rates ended the week at 2.37%. The U.S. dollar index decline", "text": "When I began posting the CBB some twenty years ago, I made a commitment to readers: \"I'll call it as I see it - and let the chips fall where they will.\" Over the years, I made a further commitment to myself: Don't be concerned with reputation - stay diligently focused on analytical integrity.\n\nI attach this odd intro to \"Issues 2019\" recognizing this is a year where I could look quite foolish. I believe Global Financial Crisis is the Paramount Issue 2019. Last year saw the bursting of a historic global Bubble, Crisis Dynamics commencing with the blow-up of \"short vol\" strategies and attendant market instabilities. Crisis Dynamics proceeded to engulf the global \"Periphery\" (Argentina, Turkey, EM, more generally, and China). Receiving a transitory liquidity boost courtesy of the faltering \"Periphery,\" speculative Bubbles at \"Core\" U.S. securities markets succumbed to blow-off excess. Crisis Dynamics finally engulfed a vulnerable \"Core\" during 2018's tumultuous fourth quarter.\n\nAs we begin a new year, rallying risk markets engender optimism. The storm has passed, it is believed. Especially with the Fed's early winding down of rate \"normalization\", there's no reason why the great bull market can't be resuscitated and extended. The U.S. economy remains reasonably strong, while Beijing has China's slowdown well under control. A trade deal would reduce uncertainty, creating a positive boost for markets and economies. With markets stabilized, the EM boom can get back on track. As always, upside volatility reenergizes market bullishness.\n\nI titled Issues 2018, \"Market Structure.\" I fully anticipate Market Structure to remain a key Issue 2019. Trend-following strategies will continue to foment volatility and instability. U.S. securities markets rallied throughout the summer of 2018 in the face of a deteriorating fundamental backdrop. That rally, surely fueled by ETF flows and derivatives strategies, exacerbated fragilities. Speculative flows fueling the upside destabilization eventually reversed course - and market illiquidity soon followed. Yet short squeezes and the unwind of market hedges create the firepower for abrupt rallies and extreme shifts in market sentiment.\n\nMarket Illiquidity is a key Issue 2019. Its Wildness Lies in Wait. Rallying risk markets create their own liquidity, with speculative leverage and derivative strategies in particular generating self-reinforcing liquidity. Recovering stock prices ensure bouts of optimism, along with confidence that robust markets enjoy liquidity abundance. Problems arise with market downdrafts and De-Risking/Deleveraging Dynamics. Rally-induced optimism feeds unreasonable expectations and eventual disappointment.\n\nCrisis Dynamics tend to be a process. There's the manic phase followed by some type of shock. There is at least a partial recovery and a return of optimism - often bolstered by a dovish central bank response. It's the second major leg down when things turn more serious - for sentiment, for market dynamics and illiquidity. Disappointment turns to disenchantment and, eventually, revulsion. It's been a long time since market participants were tested by a prolonged, grinding bear market.\n\nThe February 2018 \"short vol\" blowup was a harbinger of trouble to come. I believe the January 3, 2019 \"flash crash\" portends serious Issues 2019 in global currency markets. An 8% intraday move in the yen vs. Australian dollar exposed problematic liquidity dynamics. Last year, the \"short vol\" market signal was initially dismissed then soon forgotten. The recent currency market \"flash crash\" is an ominous development of potentially momentous significance.\n\nOur so-called \"king dollar\" is indicating some vulnerability to begin the new year. Newfound Fed dovishness has caught many traders too long the U.S. currency and short the yen, Canadian dollar, renminbi and EM currencies more generally. A clash among a band of fundamentally weak currencies is a critical Issue 2019. When the current currency market short squeeze runs its course, I see a marketplace that's lost its bearings. A new global currency regime of extraordinary uncertainty, instability and volatility is an Issue 2019. This unsettled new regime is not conducive to speculative leverage.\n\nThe U.S. dollar has serious fundamental issues: Trillion-dollar fiscal deficits; large structural Current Account Deficits; huge government, corporate and household debt loads; fragile securities markets; a maladjusted Bubble Economy; political dysfunction and, potentially, Washington chaos; and festering geopolitical risks.\n\nThe world's reserve currency is fundamentally unsound. The dollar is also the nucleus for a financial apparatus financing much of the world's levered speculative holdings. De-risking/Deleveraging Dynamics in 2018 saw waning liquidity and widening funding and hedging costs in the entangled world of dollar funding markets. With the likes of Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank seeing CDS prices rise significantly late in 2018, mounting systemic fragility would appear a serious Issue 2019.\n\nChina's currency has serious fundamental issues: A vulnerable banking system approaching $40 TN of assets (more than quadrupling since the crisis), with Trillions of potentially suspect loans; a troubled \"shadow\" banking apparatus; an historic housing Bubble with an estimated 65 million vacant units; a deeply maladjusted economic structure; Bubble economic and financial structures dependent upon ongoing loose financial conditions and rapid Credit expansion; huge financial and economic exposures to the emerging markets and the global economy more generally; a population with significantly elevated expectations prone to disappointment and dissatisfaction; and mounting geopolitical risks. In short, China's historic Bubble is increasingly susceptible to a disorderly collapse.\n\nHong Kong's Hang Seng China H-Financial Index dropped 18% in 2018, although China's banks outperformed the 28% fall in Japan's TOPIX Bank Index. I would tend to see Asian finance as especially vulnerable to the unfolding global Bubble collapse. Waning confidence in the region's financial stability would portend acute currency market instability. China's currency is especially vulnerable to capital flight and the imposition of draconian capital controls. The big unknown is how much \"hot money\" and leverage has accumulated in Chinese markets. The Indonesia rupiah remains vulnerable to tightening global finance. I worry about India's banking system after years of Bubble excess. I have concerns for the region's financial institutions generally. The stability of the perceived stable Hong Kong and Singapore dollars is on the list of Issues 2019.\n\nFragile Asian finance has company. Italian banks sank 30% in 2018, slightly outperforming the 28% drop in European bank shares (STOXX 600). Italy's 10-year yields traded to 3.72% in late-November, before ending 2018 at 2.74% (up 73bps in '18). Italian - hence European - stability is an Issue 2019.\n\nI believe a problematic crisis is likely to unfold in 2019, perhaps sparked by dislocation in Italian debt markets and the resulting crisis of confidence in Italy's fragile banking system. Serious de-risking/deleveraging in Italian debt would surely see contagion in the vulnerable European periphery - including Greece, Spain and Portugal. Italy's Target2 balances (liabilities to other eurozone central banks) almost reached $500 billion in 2018. Heightened social and political instability would appear a major Issue 2019, not coincidental with the end of ECB liquidity-creating operations. Draghi had kicked the can down the road. Markets, economies, politicians and protestors have about reached the can.\n\nA crisis of confidence in Europe would ensure problematic currency market instability. Such a scenario would portent difficulties for vulnerable \"developing\" Eastern European markets and economies. Many economies would appear vulnerable to being locked out of global financing markets. A full-fledged financial crisis engulfing Turkey cannot be ruled out. Last year saw significant currency weakness also in the Russian ruble, Iceland krona, Hungarian forint and Polish zloty. I would see 2018 difficulties as a harbinger of much greater challenges ahead.\n\nBubbles are mechanism of wealth redistribution and destruction. This reality has been at the foundation of my ongoing deep worries for the consequences of history's greatest global Bubble. We've witnessed the social angst, a deeply divided country and waning confidence in U.S. institutions following the collapse of the mortgage finance Bubble. I fear that the Bubble over the past decade has greatly increased the likelihood of geopolitical tensions and conflict. Aspects of this risk began to manifest in 2018, as fissures developed in the global Bubble. Geopolitical conflict is a critical Issue 2019. Trade relations are clearly front and center. Going forward, I don't believe we can disregard escalating risks of military confrontation.\n\nBubbles inflate many things, including expectations. I worry that the protracted Chinese Bubble has so inflated expectations throughout China's large population. With serious cracks in their Bubble, Beijing will continue to craft a strategy of casting blame on the U.S. (and the \"west\"). The administration's hard line creates a convenient narrative: Trump and the U.S. are trying to hold back China's advancement and ascendency to global superpower status. A faltering Bubble and deteriorating situation in China present Chinese leadership a not inconvenient time to confront the hostile U.S. The South China Sea and Taiwan could loom large as surprise flashpoint Issues 2019.\n\nThere are a number of potential geopolitical flashpoints. Without delving into detail, I would say generally that geopolitical risks will continue to rise rapidly in the post-Bubble backdrop. Issues easily disregarded during the Bubble expansion (i.e. the Middle East, Russia, Ukraine, Iran, etc.) may in total become more pressing Issues 2019. I can see a scenario where the U.S. is spending significantly more on national defense in the not too distant future.\n\n\"Chairman Powell 'very worried' about massive debt\" was an early-2019 headline. I believe the U.S. Treasury market in 2018 hinted at a momentous change in Market Dynamics. And while a bout of \"risk off\" and a powerful short squeeze fueled a big year-end rally, there were times when the Treasury market's traditional safe haven appeal seemed to have lost some luster. The unfolding bursting Bubble predicament turns even more problematic if ever Treasury yields rise concurrently with faltering risk markets. Such a scenario seemed more realistic in 2018. With huge and expanding deficits as far as the eye can see, the suspect dollar and mounting geopolitical tensions, the potential for a disorderly rise in Treasury yields is a potential surprise Issue 2019.\n\nWhether Treasury yields surprise on the upside or fall further in an unfolding crisis backdrop, U.S. corporate Credit is a pressing Issue 2019. Thursday (Jan. 10) ended a 40-day drought in junk bond issuance (longest stretch since at least 1995). Both high-yield and investment-grade funds suffered major redemptions in late-2018, exposing how abruptly financial conditions can tighten throughout corporate finance. Fueling liquidity abundance throughout the boom, ETF flows were exposed as a critical market risk.\n\nFlows for years have been dominated by trend-following and performance-chasing strategies on the upside. The reversal of bullish speculative flows was joined in late-2018 by speculative shorting and hedging-related selling. Liquidity abundance abruptly transformed into unmanageable selling pressure and acute illiquidity. Pernicious Market Structure was revealed and, outside of short squeezes and fleeting bouts of optimism, I believe putting the ETF humpty dumpty back together will prove difficult. The misperception of ETF \"moneyness\" is being cracked wide open.\n\nEnormous leverage has accumulated throughout corporate Credit over the past decade. This portends negative surprises and challenges in the unfolding backdrop. At this point, I'll assume some type of trade agreement is cobbled together with the Chinese. This might provide near-term support for the markets and global economy. But I don't believe a trade agreement would fundamentally change the backdrop of faltering global financial and economic Bubbles.\n\nExpect ongoing global pressure on leveraged speculation. As an industry, the hedge funds did not experience huge redemptions in 2018. I expect redemptions and fund closures to be a significant issue following the next bout of serious de-risking/deleveraging. A similar dynamic should be expected for the ETF complex. Late-2018 outflows were likely just a warmup for the type of destabilizing flows possible in a panic environment.\n\nIn my view, an important interplay evolved during this protracted cycle between the ETF complex and a booming derivatives marketplace. Reliable inflows and abundant liquidity in the ETF universe created an advantageous backdrop for structuring and trading various derivatives strategies. This seemingly symbiotic relationship has run its course. The now highly uncertain ETF flow backdrop translates into a potentially problematic liquidity dynamic for derivative-related trading. ETF outflows pose risk to derivatives strategies, while a derivatives-induced market dislocation risks destroying investor faith in the liquidity and safety of ETF passive \"investing.\"\n\nThe possibility of a 1987-style \"portfolio insurance\" debacle except on a grander - global, multi-asset class - scale is an Issue 2019. The U.S. economy has vulnerabilities. Yet Unsound Finance is a predominant Issue 2019. Outside of possible dreadful geopolitical developments, I would argue that the key major risk for 2019 is the seizing up of global markets. Unprecedented amounts of risks have accumulated across markets around the globe. Consider a particularly problematic scenario: a major de-risking/deleveraging episode sparks upheaval and illiquidity across currencies, equities and fixed-income markets. Such a scenario might incite a crisis of confidence in major global financial institutions, including derivatives markets and counterparties. Central bankers better not disappoint.\n\nLast week's dovish turn by Chairman Powell broke the bearish spell and reversed markets higher, though this came weeks late in the eyes of most market participants. \"We know that long periods of suppressed volatility can lead to the build-up of risks and to a disruptive ending, and the idea that monetary policy can ignore that and leave it to macroprudential tools just is not credible to me.\" This prescient comment (released Friday) is extracted from 2013 Federal Reserve transcripts. Governor Powell at the time clearly had a firmer grasp of the risks associated with QE than chairman Bernanke and future chair Yellen.\n\nIt is my long-held view that the Fed (and the other major central banks) will see no alternative than to resort to QE when global markets \"seize up.\" Ten-year Treasury yields at 2.70%, German bund yields at 22 bps and JGBs at zero don't seem inconsistent with this view. It's been a decade (or three) of Monetary Disorder. Now come the consequences, commencing with acute market and price instability. I believe this instability will end in a serious and prolonged crisis. There will be policy interventions, of course. But it will become increasingly clear that flawed monetary doctrine and policies are more the problem than the solution. In an increasingly acrimonious world, how closely will policymakers coordinate crisis responses? Will central bankers stick with \"whatever it takes\"? How quickly will they react to the markets - and with how much firepower? Uncertainty associated with monetary policymaking in a global crisis environment is an Issue 2019.\n\nFor the Week\n\nThe S&P 500 jumped 2.5% (up 3.6% y-t-d), and the Dow rose 2.4% (up 2.9%).

He had previously said he would be \"proud\" to close down the government in the wall fight.\n\nHe offered a three-year reprieve from deportation to undocumented migrants brought to the US as children who are covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and to people from certain nations who qualify for Temporary Protected Status.\n\n\"This is a common-sense compromise both parties should embrace,\" Trump said, apparently seeking to portray himself as a deal maker taking the initiative to end a record-long shutdown now in its 29th day that has left 800,000 federal workers without a paycheck.\n\nHe also appeared to offer a concession on the characteristics of his border wall -- one of his most iconic political goals. He described the wall as a \"strategic deployment of physical barriers or a wall. This is not a 2000-mile concrete structure from sea to shining sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations.\"\n\nBut the President also sprinkled his speech with his hardline immigration rhetoric and made questionable claims about how the wall would transform the fight against drugs trafficking and violent crime in America. Such language is unlikely to entice Democrats into the compromise Trump said he was seeking.\n\n\"The radical left can never control our borders. I will never let it happen,\" Trump said.\n\nThe President notably did not mention the plight of federal workers going without paychecks, some of whom fear they may not be able to make mortgage, rent or car payments, or are relying on food banks.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not even wait for the speech to reject the proposal. She said it was a \"a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to people's lives.\"\n\n\"It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter. For one thing, this proposal does not include the permanent solution for the Dreamers and TPS recipients that our country needs and supports,\" Pelosi said in a statement.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that the President's offer was not really an offer at all.\n\n\"It was the President who singled-handedly took away DACA and TPS protections in the first place -- offering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking,\" Schumer said in a statement.\n\nThough it was quickly rejected by Democrats, Trump's proposal could move the politics of the shutdown to a new stage, as various bills to reopen the government and fund the wall are debated on Capitol Hill, after weeks of fruitless negotiations between Democrats and the President.\n\nHis plan however appeared to be as much an effort to ease his own political predicament on the shutdown as a true attempt to tempt Democrats into a deal as it did not seriously address their demands and he did not consult them before making his announcement.\n\nHouse Democrats have passed a number of bills that would reopen the government or individual agencies, but they have gone nowhere in the Senate.\n\nSenate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been on the sidelines since before Christmas, signaled an effort to raise pressure on Democrats by promising to put Trump's proposal on the Senate floor next week. Previously, McConnell said he would only move on bills that had the support of the President and Democrats.\n\n\"I commend the President for his leadership in proposing this bold solution to reopen the government, secure the border, and take bipartisan steps toward addressing current immigration issues,\" McConnell said in a statement.\n\n\"Compromise in divided government means that everyone can't get everything they want every time. The President's proposal reflects that. It strikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\nAnd Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who has emerged as a frequent Trump critic after only a few weeks in the chamber also backed the plan.\n\n\"@POTUS has put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border. I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same,\" Romney wrote on Twitter.\n\nBut there was immediate pushback from the far right -- in a reminder of the criticism by conservative pundits that caused Trump to pull out of a deal to keep the government open late last year.\n\n\"Trump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\" said Ann Coulter on Twitter, referring to former Florida governor and GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush.\n\n\"100 miles of border wall in exchange for amnestying millions of illegals. So if we grant citizenship to a BILLION foreigners, maybe we can finally get a full border wall,\" Coulter wrote in another tweet.\n\nTrump's proposal includes $800 million for urgent humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, as well additional border agents, law enforcement officials and new immigration judge teams to deal with cases of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nThough Trump did bring up the issue of DACA recipients, the President's refusal to offer a permanent path to citizenship is a deal breaker for Democrats.\n\nLast year, Democratic senators worked on a deal with Republicans which offered $25 billion in border funding in exchange for a permanent path to citizenship for some 1.8 million Dreamers.

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina had floated such a compromise to the President as early as late December.\n\nAnother source told CNN the plan is modeled after proposals Democrats have supported and voted for in the past in an added effort to pressure them back to the negotiating table.\n\nThough he didn't come up with or help craft the proposal, McConnell offered suggestions over the last two days as to how to move the plan forward, a source familiar told CNN.

Graff", "source": "Wired", "summary": "An explosive new report from Buzzfeed News makes the impeachment of Donald Trump not just possible, but likely.", "text": "As the government shutdown neared the one-month mark, the political landscape shifted under Washington\u2019s feet Thursday night, dramatically and perhaps permanently altering the path of our nation\u2019s politics. BuzzFeed\u2019s duo of Russia probe reporters posted a blockbuster report that President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow Project.\n\nThe allegation, which Buzzfeed sourced to two federal law enforcement officials, simultaneously adds new information to both the \u201ccollusion\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d sides of the Russia probe. The idea that the president of the United States directed his personal attorney to lie to legislators about his attempt to complete a hundred-million-dollar deal with Vladimir Putin in the midst of the presidential campaign is, in short, as big as it gets.\n\nAs Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island and a former prosecutor, laid out, the accusation at the core of the BuzzFeed report constitutes at least four potential felonies: \u201ccriminal obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1505, 1512), subornation of perjury (18 U.S.C. 1622), conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371), and likely aiding and abetting perjury (18 U.S.C. 2).\u201d Those phrases also meant something specific to students of recent political history: Suborning perjury was part of the articles of impeachment that targeted both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nSpecial counsel spokesperson Peter Carr took the unusual step of refuting Buzzfeed's story with what appears to be a carefully worded statement. \"BuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\"\n\nWhile we\u2019ll be unpacking the implications of the apparent revelation for days to come, there are six aspects of the new report which, if true, make clear the scale of the political peril facing the president as of Friday morning:\n\n1. Mueller has the receipts. According to Buzzfeed, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators have more than Cohen\u2019s word to support the claim. In fact, the lead instead originated with documents and witnesses inside the Trump Organization, a great sign of how much visibility Mueller has into the private business world of Donald Trump pre-presidency.\n\nRemember that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg received immunity from prosecutors and is cooperating. To have both your company's accountant and your personal fixer\u2014Cohen\u2014turn on you usually is criminally fatal. This report from BuzzFeed, as rich in detail as it is, probably represents just the tip of the iceberg of Mueller\u2019s knowledge. Every single indictment and court filing from Mueller has been more detailed, more knowledgeable, and better informed than we imagined. And this is just one of at least 17 investigations targeting the president's circle right now, run by at least seven different sets of prosecutors. The potential criminal liability remains enormous.\n\n2. The politics just changed in a big way. Any investigation that targets the president of the United States is more a political question than a criminal question. The ultimate judge and jury would almost certainly be Congress or the voters, either in an impeachment trial or a reelection bid.\n\nThe president's family is potentially in lots of legal trouble.\n\nThese allegations are about lying to Congress, which makes it harder for Congress to brush them away\u2014and given the new Democratic majority in the House, they\u2019re certainly not inclined to. Democrats in Congress were quick out of the gate hinting at the \u201cI\u201d word (which coincidentally also appears on the cover of the latest issue of The Atlantic). The chair of the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment articles would begin, moved further than he has before in discussing the seriousness of the accusation.\n\nThe allegation that the president is instructing people to lie to Congress cuts to the heart of its legitimacy as a co-equal branch of government. While they\u2019ve so far seemingly ignored the fact that the president, aka Individual 1, is already an unindicted co-conspirator in Cohen\u2019s campaign finance case, lying to Congress is the kind of violation that gets even staid institutionalists squawking.\n\n3. The obstruction case could be much bigger than Comey. The BuzzFeed report also helps provide context to our evolving understanding of a potential obstruction of justice case focused on the president. Whereas we\u2019ve tended to shorthand that area of the probe as focusing on the firing of FBI director James Comey, it\u2019s quite possible that Mueller won\u2019t in the end focus on any single incident, but will instead paint a broader picture of Trump's apparent years-long effort to hide the truth of his dealings with Russia, during the campaign, the transition, and even into the White House.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for some time that Mueller was interested in the cover-up of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, as well. As I mentioned in December, he has already pointed us to what worries him: \u201cA specific line from the special counsel\u2019s filing in Cohen\u2019s case also jumps out: \u2018By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what had occurred in hopes of limiting the investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\u2019 It\u2019s not hard to imagine that same line cut and pasted into a future obstruction case regarding Donald Trump\u2019s personal handling of a false narrative put out by the White House after reports first surfaced of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nIf Cohen was conspiring with the president, after the fact, to cover up the Trump Tower Moscow project, that would alter the whole timeline of an obstruction case. It would no longer hinge on Trump\u2019s thinking on the precise date in May 2017 when he fired Comey, but instead could point to a pattern of actions and behaviors over nearly three years\u2014up to present day, potentially\u2014that would be hard to explain away as constitutionally valid.\n\n4. The president's family is potentially in lots of legal trouble. The BuzzFeed report also says that Cohen kept the Trump children up to date on his plans, which was hinted at in the earlier court filings around Cohen's guilty plea concerning his lies to Congress. We've long known that unnamed \"executives\" of the Trump Organization were involved in both the campaign finance conspiracy surrounding the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, as well as the Moscow Trump Tower project. The most likely suspects have always been Trump's children\u2014the idea, after all, that the vaunted \"Trump Organization\" is anything more in day-to-day reality than a small family business has long been a fiction. It's Donald Trump and his children. The BuzzFeed reporting now attaches names\u2014Ivanka and Donald Jr.\u2014to that suspicion and shows that the president's family and his innermost circle are almost certainly going to be wrapped up in the investigation in the days, weeks, or months ahead. That's doubly true given that the House Intelligence Committee plans to hand over additional evidence to Mueller of other witnesses it suspects lied to Congress\u2014a list that seems likely to include Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe president has brushed away other targets of Mueller's probe as coffee boys, short-timers, or people he hardly knew. It's tougher to do that if it's your son or daughter, but not impossible given the president's only casual affiliation to the truth.\n\n5. Trump's incoming attorney general already said it's a crime. This week, US attorney general nominee William Barr appears to have already boxed himself in. While much of the questioning of Barr focused on how, when, and what he might make public from a still-theoretical \u201cMueller report,\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota zeroed in on what Barr would consider troublesome behavior by the occupant of the White House: \u201cThe president persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction, is that right?\u201d Barr\u2019s answer was simple: \u201cYes.\u201d Which is to say, two days before tentative evidence emerged that Trump allegedly did just that, his presumptively incoming attorney general said that behavior would surely represent a crime.\n\nRemember, we again likely only know a fraction of the evidence Mueller could present about the president\u2019s behavior at this point.\n\n6. Trump's defense team is rattled. Lastly, the president\u2019s TV lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tried unsuccessfully to move the goalposts of the investigation this week. After months of endlessly repeating the phrase \u201cno collusion,\u201d Giuliani tried to tell CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that he had only meant there was no personal collusion by the president himself\u2014he can\u2019t speak for the rest of the campaign: \u201cI never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign. I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.\u201d\n\nMost of the umbrage at the absurdity of Giuliani\u2019s statement focused on the first half, but the second half is almost more interesting from the standpoint of how the president\u2019s potential defense is shaping up\u2014evidently, that it would only be a crime if the president actively conspired in advance with Russian intelligence to attack and leak Democratic officials\u2019 inboxes. Of course, that\u2019s absurd. There are any manner of crimes Donald Trump could have committed either before or after the DNC hack\u2014and while we haven't seen public evidence of such crimes, it certainly seems like the president\u2019s own defenders are worried evidence exists.\n\nPutting it all together, unfortunately, we\u2019re still left with this: The president should almost hope that Robert Mueller concludes he\u2019s a Russian agent, because the alternative might be even worse. As I wrote earlier this week, a lifetime ago in this investigation given Thursday\u2019s new bombshell, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in the Mueller probe where there are only two scenarios left: Either the president is compromised by the Russian government and has been working covertly to cooperate with Vladimir Putin after Russia helped win him the 2016 election\u2014or Trump will go down in history as the world\u2019s most famous \u2018useful idiot,\u2019 as communists used to call those who could be co-opted to the cause without realizing it.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s revelations\u2014lending new weight to both the obstruction and collusion questions\u2014make clear that the answer might be, simply \u201cboth, all of the above.\u201d\n\nGarrett M.

The actual response, of course, has been anything but that. America\u2019s newly divided government has kicked off 2019 by closing itself, practically doing the Kremlin\u2019s work for it. Who needs a foreign adversary when there\u2019s an opposing party?\n\nThe most consequential foreign-policy downside of the shutdown, however, is in the realm of ideas.\n\nToday, Republicans and Democrats generally agree that the United States has reentered an era of great power competition, in which Beijing and Moscow wish to contest the attractiveness of democratic government and shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model. Many policy makers are newly worried that alternatives to liberal democracy will gain currency, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle concur. Senator Mitt Romney cautions that the alternative offered by China and Russia is \u201cautocratic, corrupt, and brutal,\u201d while Bernie Sanders has called for solidarity among democracies in the face of an \u201cauthoritarian axis.\u201d\n\nThis competition of democracy versus dictatorship is to a degree a contest of narratives\u2014and the government shutdown plays into the wrong one. Beijing and others peddle a seemingly attractive story: that fractious, paralyzed democracies simply can\u2019t muster the will to deliver the goods their people want. Better, they suggest, to embrace an effective, tech-fueled autocracy that can move nimbly to pursue national interests and spread prosperity. What\u2019s a bit of free speech and the right to choose your leaders if those leaders merely squabble while strongmen lead their populations boldly forward? Government derives its just powers, they suggest, from the convenience of the governed.\n\nEven recently, this line of argument would have been seen by the vast majority of people as obviously wrong, and until recently polls showed that majorities in virtually every region of the world favored democracy. But liberal democracies continue to create unfortunate grist for the mill.\n\nA year ago\u2014and remember, the last major shutdown was only last January\u2014China\u2019s official news agency published a commentary saying, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States today will make more people worldwide reflect on the viability and legitimacy of such a chaotic political system.\u201d This time around, the Global Times, Beijing\u2019s jingoistic, English-language outlet, doubled down. \u201cAmericans boldly portray their democracy as a global model and sell its standard worldwide,\u201d the newspaper said. But \u201cthe government shutdown has been going on for nearly three weeks and involves 800,000 government employees not being able to work normally. This is too much even for the US.

It\u2019s easy, among the resignations, the shutdowns, the withdrawals, and the pronouncements on both nuclear options and nuclear weapons swirling into a vortex at the midpoint of Trump\u2019s first term, to panic or despair.\n\nWhile we are also tempted to break the proverbial glass and fire off our emergency flares, one consideration is compelling us to keep our powder dry: We\u2019re not sure President Trump\u2019s chaotic methods are significantly worse than what we got from the status quo of the bipartisan elite.\n\nTrump's actions and the other news are legitimate causes for concern. His promise of a government shutdown at Christmas, and his taking credit for it from the Oval Office, do not comprise moves of shrewd or prudent political chess. Further, we\u2019re not sure what victory looks like in this fight: What sort of border wall could be built for $5 billion?\n\nOn the other hand, we don\u2019t exactly have a good prescription for how to handle potential government shutdowns. Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s, R-Ky., practice since the 2014 election has been to cave on every demand \u2014 even taxpayer funding of Planned Parenthood \u2014 lest Republicans get blamed for a government shutdown. The result has been that Democrats get everything they want, and they have an incentive to bring about more potential shutdowns.\n\nIf this is the status quo, can we say with certainty that Trump\u2019s cowboy approach to shutdowns is worse? Consider that question, along with the fact that Republicans seemingly paid no political price at all in 2014 after shutting down the government and bringing it to the precipice of a debt-ceiling emergency in late 2013.\n\nTrump\u2019s lobbying for the legislative nuclear option also appears rash. The filibuster, on net, probably helps conservatives. In the long run, a Senate more capable of passing laws implies a government more likely to expand in size and power. Particularly, abolition of the filibuster now seems to have very limited upside, considering that Democrats will control the House in two weeks, already blocking the GOP\u2019s ability to pass conservative legislation.\n\nThen again, here we have to question the status quo. Democrats have managed to pass their New Deal, their Great Society, and their Obamacare, while Republicans have been foiled from rolling back or reforming the many resulting and unaffordable entitlement programs. As Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointed out to us in an editorial board interview earlier this year, the Democrats are likely to invoke the \u201cnuclear option\u201d once they get control of the Senate. So why not do it now?\n\nMost worrisome to Washingtonians \u2014 including us \u2014 have been Trump\u2019s actions regarding war and defense. Pulling all troops from Syria right away, without much deliberation, while thousands of Islamic State forces remain, appears rash. And it appears to have triggered the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, perhaps the most revered man in the Trump administration. Trump has similarly hinted he wants a quick pullout from Afghanistan.\n\nThe loss of Mattis and the precipitous withdrawals have provoked mass consternation among the foreign policy establishment. Then again, that might not be a bad thing. Over the past two decades, the bipartisan foreign policy establishment has gotten us into two imprudent wars, two unwinnable nation-building morasses, and countless other shooting fights.

Neither are the government services that have been affected, nor the national parks and museums that have been closed amid the standoff. President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - and their political game of tit for tat - are now front and center.\n\nTrump on Thursday abruptly denied military aircraft to Pelosi for a seven-day foreign trip just minutes before the congressional delegation was set to depart, a stunning decision that followed her call to delay Trump\u2019s scheduled State of the Union address amid the government shutdown.\n\n\"In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,\u201d Trump wrote in his letter to Pelosi. \"I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the Strong Border Security movement to end the Shutdown.\"\n\nTrump also canceled the U.S. delegation's planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., ripped both leaders in a series of tweets, telling Trump that \"one sophomoric response does not deserve another.\" This much is certain: Both sides remain as far apart as ever in the dispute over funding for Trump's long-promised border wall.

The salacious anti-Trump dossier by former British spy Christopher Steele that launched the investigation has been discredited, they argue. Newly confirmed congressional testimony from former Justice Department official Bruce Ohr proves that the DOJ -- and members of Mueller's team -- were aware of Steele's anti-Trump bias.\n\nIn an op-ed for FoxNews.com, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett argues that Mueller should have investigated officials at the DOJ for their ties to the dossier. Instead, he hired them for his team. \"The integrity of Mueller\u2019s special counsel team has been compromised. The credibility of any forthcoming report should be viewed through the lens of deep skepticism,\" Jarrett writes.\n\nTHE CARAVAN IS COMING: Approximately 1,000 Central American migrants in the newest caravan have begun the process of crossing into Mexico from Guatemala, a Mexican immigration official stationed at the border between the two countries told Fox News on Thursday night ...

The new system is meant to keep things orderly after the last caravan rushed the border via the Suchiate River at the Guatemalan border city of Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n. Members of the caravan are staying in Guatemalan shelters and camping out in a nearby park.

Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nDrowned out amid news of the government shutdown and questions about whether the president will attempt to declare a national emergency to build his border wall, this week saw several small but significant developments in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nFirst, we learned that Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with members of the Trump campaign, has much stronger connections to the Kremlin than previously known. On Tuesday, a newly unsealed federal indictment revealed that Veselnitskaya was charged with misleading investigators in 2015 about her role in drafting the Russian government\u2019s response to a U.S. request for records in a civil money laundering case against Cyprus-based Prevezon Holdings. That alleged scheme ultimately led to the passage of the Magnitsky Act, which imposes sanctions on Russian government officials and is named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in Russian prison after investigating the alleged fraud. While this case is separate from Mueller\u2019s investigation, the news of Veselnitskaya\u2019s role in crafting a Russian government response indirectly draws yet another link between the Kremlin and Trump campaign. Further, Donald Trump Jr. had initially claimed that the Trump Tower meeting was itself about adoptions of Russian children\u2014a key talking point of Magnitsky Act opponents\u2014before eventually conceding that the meeting\u2019s initial purpose was to discuss campaign dirt against Hillary Clinton and claiming that it ended up being about the Magnitsky Act instead.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers accidentally revealed in what was supposed to be a redacted filing that Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman shared polling data with Russian intelligence operative Konstantin Kilimnik in the spring of 2016. This demonstrated yet another link between the Kremlin and the Trump campaign at a time when the Kremlin was working to sway the 2016 election in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\nThese two developments are significant but relatively small: They are data points that will help inform the ultimate findings of the investigation, two steps forward in our journey from \u2018what if\u2019 to \u2018what else\u2019?\n\nThe newly Democrat-controlled House represents the ultimate safety valve for Mueller\u2019s findings.\n\nMore important than these revelations, though, it was reported that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who has been supervising the Mueller investigation and likely protecting it from political interference, will be leaving his position in the coming months. The news comes at a time when the Justice Department is headed by Trump-appointed interim Attorney General Matt Whitaker, who has been critical of the Mueller investigation and even gone on cable news to pitch methods by which the president could kill off the investigation. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s nominee to permanently head the department, William Barr, has also been critical of the investigation and reportedly refused to meet with Democratic senators this week to discuss, among other things, his stance on the investigation. At the same time, the White House is reported to be hiring nearly 20 new attorneys who will work to keep the president\u2019s conversations with top advisers from being released in Mueller\u2019s report or to House investigators.\n\nTaken together, the news that Rosenstein is leaving, Whitaker\u2019s and Barr\u2019s views on the investigation, and the White House\u2019s new legal hires have prompted some to worry that the stage is being set for the president to quash the report.\n\nIn addition to being able to fire Mueller or cut his funding\u2014as Whitaker once suggested a new attorney general could do\u2014Mueller\u2019s new supervisor can, per the rules governing the special counsel\u2019s appointment, \u201crequest that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.\u201d Mueller must also inform his new supervisor about any major developments in his investigation. This includes giving that person advance notice about criminal charges that he intends to file. Finally, Mueller\u2019s supervisor is the person who will receive the report containing the findings of his investigation. This means that the new attorney general can decide whether to make the document public, share it with Congress, or keep it locked away.\n\nBut there is a good chance that it will ultimately prove impossible to keep the facts of the investigation from reaching the public and its representatives in Congress. If Mueller\u2019s likely new boss, Barr, tries to suppress the report, the special counsel has a number of options available to him. For example, if Barr claims the document contains classified information, sealed grand jury material, or personal data that would violate the privacy interests of those named in the report, Mueller can simply withhold parts of the report containing such information, or he can publish an executive summary that presents the investigation\u2019s key findings. As Ben Wittes points out, even if such documents are relatively sparse, they could be used by lawmakers to guide their own investigations, the results of which could then be made public.\n\nThe newly Democrat-controlled House represents the ultimate safety valve for Mueller\u2019s findings. At the end of Mueller\u2019s investigation, should Barr decline Mueller\u2019s proposals for further action, such as prosecuting individuals discovered to have broken the law (including the president) or releasing the report itself, the attorney general is required to inform Congress that he is rejecting Mueller\u2019s requests along with an explanation as to why. And the attorney general must have a good reason for overruling the special counsel. As Neal Katyal, the former Justice Department official who wrote the rules governing Mueller\u2019s appointment, tweeted on Wednesday night:\n\nWe wrote the circumstances for an AG to overrule a Special Counsel very tightly\u2014it has to violate \u201cestablished Departmental practices.\u201d So, to take one hypothetical example, generic DOJ opinions about whether a sitting President could be indicted do not create an \u201cestablished Departmental practice\u201d about whether an individual could be indicted for successfully cheating in a Presidential election. There is no DOJ established practice that says if a Presidential candidate cheats enough and wins the Presidency, that he gets a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nAnd in the event Mueller finds evidence that the president committed serious crimes and the Justice Department nevertheless declines to indict him, that information would be turned over to Congress, which could then move to impeach him, according to Katyal.\n\nAs for the possibility that the White House will be able to claim executive privilege in order to squelch the release of damning information, Katyal put it well:\n\nNixon tried that, it didn\u2019t turn out so well. He got crushed in the Supreme Court.", "stance": "R", "url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/rod-rosenstein-resigning-robert-mueller-investigation.html", "imageUrl": "https://compote.slate.com/images/27d46581-8c55-441c-96cb-4da7bed4d874.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "datePublished": "2019-01-11T23:10:45Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Senate Republicans rebuke McConnell, Trump on Russia sanctions resolution - Fox News", "author": "Gregg Re", "source": "Fox News", "summary": "Senate Republicans rebuke McConnell, Trump on Russia sanctions resolution Fox News In a remarkable rebuke of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the White House, several Republicans on Tuesday joined with Democrats to keep alive...

The Republicans who defied McConnell on the procedural vote were Sens. John Kennedy, Susan Collins, Marco Rubio, John Boozman, Tom Cotton, Steve Daines, Cory Gardner, Josh Hawley, Ben Sasse, Martha McSally and Jerry Moran.\n\nMcConnell set up another procedural vote Wednesday to end debate on the resolution. The vote, set for 12:30 p.m. ET, needs 60 votes to pass.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only a few Republican votes short of the U.S. Senate telling Putin he can\u2019t run the show no matter what President Trump and his administration try to do,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"If Republican Senators agree with Leader McConnell, who said that Putin is a \u2018thug\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019ll vote yes tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was urging senators on Tuesday to vote against Schumer's resolution, which called for maintaining sanctions on companies linked to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The measure would block a Treasury Department move, announced in December, to lift penalties against the aluminum manufacturing giant Rusal and two other companies connected to Deripaska.\n\nThe 2017 sanctions law permits Congress to override the White House's efforts to reduce penalties on Russia, but a 60-vote threshold would effectively be required to defeat Trump's potential veto.\n\nMnuchin met with Republican senators behind closed doors Tuesday in the hours before a planned Senate vote on the Schumer sanctions resolution.\n\nPELOSI SLAMS MNUCHIN AFTER CLASSIFIED BRIEFING, SAYS HE WASTED DEMS' TIME AND 'BARELY' SAID ANYTHING\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Mnuchin said, \"We have been tougher on Russia with more sanctions than any other administration.\" He said the sanctions \"shouldn't be a political issue.\"\n\nTuesday's development marked a striking defeat not only for Mnuchin, and the latest in a string of losses for McConnell. For more than a week, McConnell has tried and failed on three occasions to get the Senate to start debate on a bill to assist Israel and sanction Syria. Each of the procedural votes to launch debate on that measure went down to defeat.\n\nIn the new Congress, the Republican Senate has failed three times to begin debate on a measure backed by McConnell. But the first measure on which the Senate actually was able to begin debate in the new Congress is the one backed by Schumer.\n\nThe Treasury Department says the Russian companies have committed to separating from Deripaska, who will remain blacklisted as part of an array of measures announced in early April that targeted tycoons close to the Kremlin. It also warns that the sanctions could upset global aluminum markets.\n\nThe vote comes as Democrats have questioned President Trump's Russian ties and questioned whether his administration is being too soft on Russia.\n\nSchumer, who introduced the resolution and called for a vote on it, called the Treasury Department decision \"sanctions relief for President [Vladimir] Putin's trusted agents.\" Congress has 30 days to block the move to terminate the sanctions.\n\nDemocratic House leaders have also criticized the move and are considering a similar vote. The new Democratic chairmen of seven committees called Mnuchin in for a classified briefing last week on the easing of the sanctions.\n\nAt issue is a December announcement from the Treasury Department that the U.S. would lift sanctions on the three companies \u2014 Rusal, EN+ Group and the Russian power company JSC EuroSibEnergo. EN+ Group is a holding company that owns nearly 50 percent of Rusal.\n\nIn a letter asking Mnuchin for a briefing, the committee chairmen said the sanctions deal appears to allow Deripaska to keep \"significant ownership\" of one of the companies. They did not elaborate.\n\nThe Treasury Department maintains that the companies have committed to diminish Deripaska's ownership and sever his control. In a statement released ahead of the House briefing, Mnuchin reiterated that Deripaska remains under sanctions, \"his property and interests remain blocked, and any companies he controls are also sanctioned.\"\n\nTreasury added that if the companies remained under sanctions, the Russian government might move to nationalize the company, thus shutting it out from any outside control.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats have asked for an extension of the 30-day timeline because the sanctions announcement came just before a holiday recess and the start of the government shutdown. Mnuchin said after his Senate meeting Tuesday that they will see how the Senate vote goes.\n\n\"Our view is that we have great responsibility in managing the sanctions programs all over the world, and we take those responsibilities very seriously at Treasury,\" Mnuchin said.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "stance": "R", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-republicans-rebuke-mcconnell-trump-on-russia-sanctions-resolution", "imageUrl": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/01/08/694940094001_5987252591001_5987249755001-vs.jpg", "datePublished": "2019-01-15T22:54:24Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Norway says video from Morocco is likely authentic following double murder of Scandinavian women - AOL", "author": "Alexander Kay", "source": "Aol.com", "summary": "Norway says video from Morocco is likely authentic following double murder of Scandinavian women AOL ISIS Blamed for Murder of Scandinavian Women on Camera in Morocco The Daily Beast Video allegedly shows university students' murder in Morocco CBS News Nine m\u2026", "text": "Police in Norway say a video that allegedly shows the killing of a Scandinavian university student in a remote part of Morocco's Atlas Mountains likely is authentic.\n\nNorway's National Criminal Investigation Service has been investigating the footage circulating on social media.

But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years and reflects a shift in the party itself.\n\nWhile echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, the Green New Deal aims to combat both climate change and income inequality.

Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nIn the last week, we\u2019ve learned several new things about past and ongoing contacts between President Donald Trump, his aides, and Russia. These revelations cast doubt on the president\u2019s denials of collusion. Trump and his surrogates dismiss these stories, but their answers raise further questions. Those questions can and should be investigated.\n\nHere are the new developments. First: A week ago, documents filed by Paul Manafort\u2019s lawyers revealed that in early 2016, while working on Trump\u2019s campaign, Manafort shared the campaign\u2019s private poll data with Konstantin Kilimnik, an associate connected to Russian intelligence.\n\nSecond: On Friday, the New York Times reported that Trump\u2019s firing of then\u2013FBI Director James Comey in May 2017, compounded by the president\u2019s suspicious behavior, led the FBI to open an investigation into whether Trump was \u201cworking on behalf of Russia against American interests.\u201d\n\nThird: On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that within the White House, Trump has \u201cgone to extraordinary lengths to conceal details of his conversations with Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin, including on at least one occasion taking possession of the notes of his own interpreter and instructing the linguist not to discuss what had transpired with other administration officials.\u201d\n\nConfronted with these disclosures, Trump has responded with lies. On Saturday, he called special counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors, who have run one of the most opaque investigations in history, \u201cleaking machines.\u201d Trump also suggested that he has been \u201ctougher than any other president\u201d on Russia, a claim that would have elicited laughter from Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, or the members of Congress who have forced Trump to accept sanctions against Putin. Trump also told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro that federal agents \u201cbroke into\u201d the office of his former lawyer, Michael Cohen\u2014a lie that Trump continues to repeat even though it has been debunked.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s responses, however, invite further investigation. They point to additional information that would clarify what he did with his Russian counterparts and whether he\u2019s telling the truth now. Here are four claims worth pursuing.\n\n1. Trump doesn\u2019t mind disclosing the contents of his meetings with Putin. On Saturday, Pirro quizzed Trump about the Post story. \u201cWhy not release the conversation that you had with President Putin in Helsinki?\u201d she asked, noting that Trump could also release documents embarrassing to the FBI officials who had investigated him. Trump replied: \u201cI would. I don\u2019t care. \u2026 I\u2019m not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t care, then he\u2019ll release the information that Congress and his own aides have sought. He could start with the interpreter\u2019s notes from his July 2017 meeting with Putin. Trump\u2019s confiscation of those notes thwarted officials from the State Department and the National Security Council who tried to find out what had transpired in the meeting. Or Trump could authorize the interpreter from his July 2018 meeting with Putin\u2014the one in Helsinki\u2014to testify about what was said, as members of Congress have requested. These steps would show good faith. Rejecting them would show the opposite.\n\n2. Trump treats Putin the same way he treats other world leaders. \u201cI have a one-on-one meeting with Putin like I do with every other leader,\u201d Trump told Pirro. On Pirro\u2019s program and in remarks to reporters on Monday, the president cited three such leaders: President Xi Jinping of China, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. \u201cI meet with all of them, but nobody says anything,\u201d Trump told Pirro. \u201cBut I meet with Putin, and they make a big deal.\u201d Speaking to the press on Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway made the same pitch. Trump\u2019s one-on-one meetings with Putin, she averred, were no different from his meetings with Modi and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.\n\nThat raises an obvious question, which a reporter posed to Conway: \u201cDid the president destroy notes with other world leaders, or was this exclusive to Putin?\u201d To be more precise, was the withholding of notes and information about such meetings\u2014from other administration officials\u2014\u201ca standard practice? Was this something he did with other world leaders?\u201d Conway told the reporter that she couldn\u2019t answer that question. \u201cI have not been able to discuss this at length with him,\u201d she said.\n\nShe\u2019d better ask him. So should Congress. If Trump hasn\u2019t kept similar control of information about meetings with other leaders, that\u2019s a sign of a corrupt relationship.\n\n3. There was nothing unusual about sharing poll data with Kilimnik. Manafort \u201conly gave him polling data. That\u2019s handed out all the time,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the New York Daily News. In an interview with the Hill, Giuliani added: \u201cThere is no legal protection of polling data. You can give it to anyone. Campaigns leak polling data all the time.\u201d\n\nThe idea that internal polls are \u201chanded out all the time\u201d to business associates in other countries would surprise anyone who has worked in senior positions on campaigns. Internal polls are held close because the questions are strategically useful (they\u2019re designed to inform campaign plans, not to inform the public) and, if leaked, would be just as useful to the other side. But if Trump\u2019s campaign handed out such numbers \u201call the time,\u201d there must be other countries whose intelligence contacts also received them. Can Trump, Manafort, or Giuliani name any such countries? Or does Russia\u2014and its Ukrainian proxies, for whom Kilimnik also worked\u2014stand, in this respect, curiously alone?\n\n4. Trump was angry about the exposure of his conversation with Russia\u2019s foreign minister. When reporters asked Conway why the president had seized the notes from his July 2017 conversation with Putin, she explained that Trump had been irked by \u201ca great number of leaks,\u201d especially from \u201can Oval Office meeting in May of 2017. Contents of that leaked. And so there was great concern at the time.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a remarkable answer. The Oval Office meeting in question was with Sergey Lavrov, Russia\u2019s foreign minister. It took place on May 10, 2017, a day after Trump fired Comey, and it was closed to the press. In the meeting, Trump told Lavrov, \u201cI just fired the head of the FBI.\u201d He added: \u201cI faced great pressure because of Russia. That\u2019s taken off.\u201d Trump also alarmed his aides by sharing sensitive intelligence with Lavrov.\n\nIn short, the meeting was deeply incriminating. The only reason we know about its contents is that a document \u201cbased on notes taken from inside the Oval Office\u201d was \u201ccirculated as the official account of the meeting,\u201d according to the New York Times, which reported Trump\u2019s comments. Conway\u2019s citation of this leak as the grounds for Trump\u2019s subsequent efforts to control information\u2014particularly by blocking the circulation of notes from his conversations with Putin\u2014raises grave questions about what Trump said to others in the White House, and to his Russian contacts, about the exposure of his comments to Lavrov.\n\nThese four lines of inquiry aren\u2019t baseless, biased, or idle. They\u2019re directly implicated by statements from Trump and his surrogates, and they can be resolved by information that\u2019s already in the possession of the White House and the Trump campaign. The president hasn\u2019t given the right answers. But he\u2019s exposing all the right questions.", "stance": "L", "url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-russia-interactions-four-questions.html", "imageUrl": "https://compote.slate.com/images/a12d2f76-d2c3-4264-b3cf-00dabf544935.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=1560x1040&offset=0x0", "datePublished": "2019-01-15T22:57:46Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "OK, This Time Is Worse Than Usual", "author": "Ben Mathis-Lilley, Ben Mathis-Lilley", "source": "Slate.com", "summary": "We have a running gag here at Slate about how every month or so a breathless insider report declares that the White House is \u201cin chaos\u201d \u2014that an \u201cincreasingly isolated\u201d Donald Trump is \u201clashing out\u201d as \u201cthe wall close in\u201d on his \u201cimperiled\u201d presidency.

These stories appear for two reasons. One is that many Washington journalists still can\u2019t wrap their heads around the reality that Trump doesn\u2019t actually lose political support or momentum, like other presidents would, when he creates giant fiascos by being an idiot. The other is that liberals love to click and read the stories because they present a wish-fulfillment fantasy in which the administration is on the verge of collapse. And yet, every time, Trump emerges from the chaos with the same level of control over the Republican Party (and thus the government) that he had before, and the country goes muddling along. (Which isn\u2019t to say, to be clear, that everything has been great since 2016\u2014that\u2019s not true\u2014but that most things in Washington, D.C. and the rest of the U.S. continue to operate in a \u201cnormal\u201d pre-Trump way and that major tragic developments have not been particularly related to White House intrigue and disorganization.)\n\nBut, OK, yes, things feel chaotic right now. This still from CNN explains it well:\n\nthe CNN chyron that sums up the day pic.twitter.com/8IbEJ5YMfV \u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) December 20, 2018\n\nLet\u2019s run down where those stories are at Friday and throw in a few more:\n\n\u2022 Secretary of Defense James Mattis is, indeed, resigning in protest over Trump\u2019s impulsive decision to withdraw forces from Syria. It\u2019s a decision that, according to the latest reporting, was more or less dictated by the authoritarian leader of Turkey\u2014who wants America out so that he can slaughter the Kurds, longtime allies of the U.S. who we are surprising/betraying by leaving so suddenly.\n\n\u2022 As the national security writer Marcy Wheeler points out, among the reasons that Trump has to be deferential toward Turkey are 1) Turkey might have dirt about former national security adviser Michael Flynn advocating corruptly for pro-Turkey policies while he was on Turkey\u2019s payroll, 2) Trump needs Turkey to stop making noise about how the Trump administration allowed Saudi Arabia to kidnap, torture, and and murder Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul without any repercussions, and 3) Turkey\u2019s interests in Syria overlap with those of Russia, another country that may possess incriminating material about corrupt behavior by Trump and Flynn that has been in the news recently because of Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel investigation. The president is possibly being blackmailed! Very neat.\n\n\u2022 Acting attorney general Matt Whitaker, a random cable-news twit who worked until recently for a company that promoted next-generation hot tubs and toilets for men with large penises before it got shut down by the FTC, has rejected advice from Department of Justice ethics officials that he recuse himself from supervising the Mueller investigation. (Whitaker criticized Mueller in cable appearances before getting initially hired at DOJ to work for ex-A.G. Jeff Sessions, and was apparently advised that those statements created the appearance of bias.) It may not surprise you that the document Whitaker has released to justify his decision appears to be incomplete and confusing; it also puts him in a position to sabotage Mueller\u2019s investigation just as it appears to be coming to a climax.\n\n\u2022 The House has passed legislation that will only continue funding the government if the budget includes $5 billion for Trump\u2019s vaunted border wall. That legislation does not seem like it can pass the Senate because it would require 60 votes (filibuster rules and all that) and there are not 60 Republicans in the Senate. But Trump has suddenly decided he won\u2019t sign any budget that does not include the funding for his widely unclamored-for 1,951-mile* wall through empty mountain/desert terrain (a wall which Mexico was supposed to pay for anyway), which means we are likely headed for a partial government shutdown.\n\n\u2022 Axios reports that Trump is already complaining about incoming interim White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who took the job only after like a hundred other people said they didn\u2019t want it.\n\n\u2022 Stock market, still not great.\n\nIn summary, while things are typically disorganized and dumb in the Trump administration, they are now getting disorganized and dumb in a way that has widespread consequences: (More) people in the Middle East dying gruesomely, people losing their paychecks in the U.S. at Christmas, and maybe an unprecedented crisis of government regarding the president\u2019s corrupt debt to foreign powers. #MAGA!\n\nCorrection, Dec. 21: This post initially misstated the length of the U.S.-Mexico border.

Among the dead is a 14-year-old girl who fell 700 feet down a canyon in Arizona. A man also died at Yosemite National Park on Christmas, and two days later a woman was killed by a falling tree at Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Although deaths and national parks are hardly uncommon\u2014an average of six die each week in the park system, according to a spokesman\u2014the series of deaths does shine a spotlight on the decision by the Trump administration to keep them open even as staffing has been kept to a bare minimum, if there is any at all.\n\nThe move to keep the parks open differentiates this shutdown from most in the past. In 1995 and 2013, for example, the parks were shut. And while the parks did stay open last year, that shutdown only lasted three days. Now the shutdown has entered its third week and many are saying it\u2019s time to close the parks. Trash is piling up, sure, but many experts also say the safety of visitors is compromised with fewer staff members present. \u201cI think we all know that not having bathrooms is a nuisance. What I think people forget is, not having adequate sewage treatment can be dangerous,\u201d Diane Regas, president and chief executive of the Trust for Public Land, said. \u201cWhen you bring people together, running these parks is like running a small city.\u201d\n\nRyan Zinke, who recently stepped down as the secretary of the Interior Department, says everyone needs to pitch in to keep the parks clean. But it\u2019s clear many visitors are also not being the most thoughtful when it comes to visiting parks during the shutdown. \u201cAt Joshua Tree and Yosemite, impacts from human waste is a concern, which includes people relieving themselves in public places, such as behind buildings [and] on roadsides,\u201d said Andrew Mu\u00f1oz, a park service spokesperson.\n\nVolunteers are teaming up with nonprofits and state governments across the country to try to keep parks safe and clean, but some are warning that these makeshift operations were not set up to last more than a few days. Trump said on Friday the shutdown could last \u201cmonths or even years.\u201d Even some who have long advocated to keep parks open say enough is enough. \u201cIt\u2019s really an awful situation to be in, but our primary job is to protect park resources and the safety of the public,\u201d said Phil Francis, the chairman of the Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks. \u201cI hate it.

Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2019\n\nThe primetime speech, which all of the major networks and cable stations have credulously agreed to cover, is the latest attempt by Trump to gin up a crisis on the southern border that the American people increasingly aren\u2019t buying. Trump aides have reportedly told the president that the calls for a wall or slats or whatever, haven\u2019t moved the needle on the contrived standoff that is the three-week long government shutdown. So expect a shift into rhetorical overdrive on the *crisis* on the border that only an emergency wall that will take years to construct can solve.\n\nWith the White House losing momentum on the arbitrary timing of the arbitrary wall backed by arbitrary levels of funding, Trump needed to make a move to make his big idea seem, well, less arbitrary and more like a crisis. Hence, you have White House surrogates disingenuously talking terrorism again on news talk shows and the president of the United States casually suggesting he might go full dictator and use executive emergency powers to push through what he has been unable to do through the normal channels of governance. Make no mistake, Trump has been unable to actualize his wall policy during two full years with Republican control over both houses of congress because he is monumentally bad at his job and building a wall is not only asinine, it is definitionally not a crisis, let alone an emergency.\n\nSince there\u2019s no actual crisis, Trump is here to create one. Again. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have anything to do. The White House says Trump will then head to the border (again) on Thursday to take a tour of some sort.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIf Donald Trump instructed his attorney Michael Cohen to lie under oath to Congress about planning a Trump real estate development in Moscow in the midst of the presidential campaign, he is almost certainly a felon. As attorney general nominee William Barr testified earlier this week in response to a question from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, suborning perjury in the midst of an investigation is the sine qua non of the crime of obstruction of justice. The remaining question is whether Republicans will join Democrats in calling for the president\u2019s removal from office.\n\nIf Graham is remotely principled, he will lead his party in calling for the president\u2019s removal, just as he advocated for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton under far less egregious circumstances 20 years ago.\n\nHe should be joined by former special prosecutor Ken Starr, who in 1998 presented a report to Congress purporting to recite \u201csubstantial and credible information \u2026 that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.\u201d In a section of that report principally authored by then\u2013Starr deputy Brett Kavanaugh, Starr argued that Clinton\u2019s purported efforts to encourage witnesses to lie\u2014including by soliciting Monica Lewinsky to file a false sworn affidavit denying her sexual relationship with the president\u2014merited impeachment, as did Clinton\u2019s efforts to cause others to lie before a grand jury. In a memo he wrote to Starr, Kavanaugh was even more emphatic, asserting that Clinton\u2019s conduct amounted to a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to the legal system.\n\nThen-Rep. Lindsey Graham, who served as one of the House \u201cmanagers\u201d who prosecuted the case for removing Clinton from office before the Senate, also assailed the president for \u201ccho[osing] to manipulate the evidence, the witnesses against him and get his friends to lie\u201d in a civil litigation. But Graham stated that what tipped the scales for him was that Clinton doubled down and continued to lie under oath after his conduct became the subject of a criminal investigation. This, Graham asserted, manifestly constituted a \u201chigh crime\u201d that virtually compelled the president\u2019s removal.\n\nThat is just what President Trump stands accused of today. While Trump has refused to testify (reportedly because his advisers are convinced he will lie), he now stands accused of directing his attorney to lie under oath to Congress regarding a matter standing at the very heart of an investigation. Furthermore, the investigation concerns a foreign adversary\u2019s attempt to influence the outcome of a presidential election, with implications for national security that are potentially graver than Watergate, let alone Starr\u2019s inquiry into Clinton\u2019s lies about his sexual activities.\n\nAs Barr stated to Graham, under the federal witness tampering statute, a person who encourages another to lie under oath bears criminal liability along with the perjurious witness.\n\nDemocratic leaders of the House have, quite properly, made it plain that they will not seek to impeach Trump unless they are joined by members of the other party. Twenty years ago, Graham argued that it was important to remove Clinton for lying in the midst of an investigation in order to place the \u201cburden\u201d on the next president not to engage in similar conduct. It now appears likely that Graham will have to decide whether to place that burden on Donald Trump.

Williams called on his RNC colleagues to change party rules to make it harder for a viable primary challenge to take shape.\n\nCurrently, any candidate who wins a plurality of delegates from five states can be nominated from the national convention floor.

Neither was authorized to speak publicly and both requested anonymity.\n\nThe Trump team has discussed the possibility of a challenge from someone such as Kasich or Flake and now, one adviser said, Romney would enter the conversation.\n\nMost in Trump\u2019s orbit were not worried about Romney, but others worried that the new article, which was published to great buzz, was merely the opening salvo in coordinated effort by some Republicans to deny the president the party\u2019s nomination.\n\nWATCH: Making government work for all is how we beat Donald Trump, says Elizabeth Warren\n\nPublicly, RNC officials were united behind the president.\n\n\u201cThere is no concern or expectation at the RNC of a primary challenge for President Trump at all,\u201d said RNC member Bill Palatucci of New Jersey, a state where Republicans suffered painful losses in November. \u201cThere may be disagreements, but you express those disagreements in private. As difficult as a midterm cycle that we had, everybody still wants a Republican president and not Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nRomney himself insisted that his article was not intended to signal any interest in a third Republican presidential bid, but he declined to endorse Trump\u2019s re-election.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided who I\u2019m going to endorse in 2020,\u201d Romney said on CNN. He continued: \u201cI\u2019m not running again. We\u2019ll see if someone else does in a Republican primary or not.

Photo by National Archive/Newsmakers/Getty Images, Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images.\n\nThis piece was originally published on Just Security, an online forum for analysis of U.S. national security law and policy.\n\nIf the president of the United States directed his personal attorney and fixer to help sabotage the Russia investigation by lying to Congress, there is no turning back for the nation. Given the independent corroborating evidence that special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly has to show that\u2019s what the president did, things are only going to get worse for the White House from here.\n\nCohen\u2019s lying to Congress (and the special counsel\u2019s office) was not only about covering up a secret deal with the Kremlin during the heart of the campaign, a deal that potentially even included an illegal payoff for Putin personally. It was also a direct hit on the Russia investigation itself. The special counsel told the court that Cohen\u2019s lies to both Congress and the special counsel were \u201cintended to limit ongoing investigations into Russian interference in a U.S. presidential election, and the question of any links or coordination between a campaign and a foreign government.\u201d\n\nWhat makes the Cohen lies even worse\u2014and yes, far worse than Watergate\u2014is that it exposed any U.S. officials who were involved in orchestrating his false testimony subject to blackmail by Russia. As Barbara McQuade, former U.S. attorney and professor at the University of Michigan Law School, wrote at Just Security, \u201cin the context of counterintelligence investigations, lies can also compromise national security. \u2026 A foreign adversary like Russia can use lies as leverage over government officials to coerce them into complying with its demands or else face exposure of the lies.\u201d\n\nAs former acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified in the context of Flynn\u2019s lying about Russian contacts, \u201cTo state the obvious, you don\u2019t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians.\u201d If Trump suborned Cohen\u2019s false statements, the president would have exposed not only himself to Kremlin blackmail, but also other members of his team who, according to court documents and reporting, helped orchestrate his personal lawyer\u2019s congressional testimony.\n\nTake a step back and you can see how the national security dimensions of \u201cRussiagate\u201d are what distinguish the case and, in many respects, makes it far worse than the cases for Nixon\u2019s or Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nThis particular act of dishonesty is of national significance.\n\nIt is also, as with Nixon\u2019s bad acts, an easy case on the law when it comes to a president\u2019s suborning false statements and obstruction of justice. Even William Barr, the man nominated for attorney general with extreme views on presidential power, has written and testified (see exchanges with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar) that suborning perjury or inducing a witness to change their testimony is a criminal act for which no presidential power protects it. And in a piece titled, \u201cNo One Is Above the Law,\u201d staunch Trump defender Alan Dershowitz wrote, \u201cIf a president\u2019s actions, on the other hand, are unlawful\u2014as President Nixon\u2019s clearly were when he told subordinates to lie to the FBI and pay hush money\u2014good intentions \u2026 would not be a defense. For purposes of the criminal law, presidents must be judged by the lawfulness or unlawfulness of their acts.\u201d\n\nWhat makes our current situation even more remarkable, and unsustainable, is that we will soon see the man who lied to Congress and the special counsel serving time for his crime, while the man who likely directed him to lie remains free, boastful, and continues to threaten the legitimacy of the Justice Department\u2019s investigations.\n\nAnd this particular act of dishonesty is of national significance. The federal court wanted to impose a stiff penalty on Cohen for good reason. Judge William H. Pauley III stated that lying to Congress in this manner \u201cstanding alone warrant[s] serious punishment.\u201d Pauley sentenced Cohen to two months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and added a financial penalty \u201cto recognize the gravity of the harm of lying to Congress in matters of national importance\u201d\u2014a sentence that would have been far higher if Cohen had not received credit for fully cooperating with the special counsel.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Cohen is most likely just the tip of the iceberg. The ways in which several Trump associates lied or intentionally misled federal authorities (see Just Security\u2019s 19-page \u201cPerjury Chart: Trump Associates\u2019 Lies, False or Misleading Statements on Russia to Federal Authorities\u201d) indicates the president may have been involved in an even more widespread conspiracy to suborn perjury, as other close observers of the Russia investigation and I have written.\n\nWhat Mueller can prove in a criminal trial is different from what can be proved in the court of public opinion and in impeachment hearings. That said, as Cohen himself wrote on Twitter, \u201c#Mueller knows everything!\u201d\n\nI hear #Prague #CzechRepublic is beautiful in the summertime. I wouldn\u2019t know as I have never been. #Mueller knows everything! \u2014 Michael Cohen (@MichaelCohen212) December 27, 2018\n\nWe can only hope that\u2019s true. With the apparent orchestration of lies by Trump associates on matters that go to the Russia investigation\u2019s core, our nation\u2019s security is vulnerable in ways that Watergate could not compare.\n\nThe road from here may very well lead to impeachment or prosecution once Trump leaves office. There are also steps that can be taken along the way.\n\nOne option is for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department for any person, the president of the United States included, when there is \u201ccredible evidence of a crime unearthed in the course of our investigations\u201d like an individual directing a witness to lie to the committee. I asked Just Security\u2019s Andy Wright, a leading expert on congressional oversight, about that option. He wrote, \u201cThe House can refer the matter to the Justice Department, and the allegation about the President suborning Cohen\u2019s perjury before Congress is within Mueller\u2019s mandate\u2014Mueller has already accepted a guilty plea from Cohen for those lies.\u201d Either house of Congress can also formally move to censure the president, which may be a stepping stone to more formidable options.\n\nBut all we have Friday is a news report, albeit from two highly reputable journalists with distinguished track records in uncovering matters core to this part of the Russia investigation. Their report contains no quotes from Cohen\u2019s testimony, emails, or other documents. It will be up to Congress, dogged journalism, and the FBI to help complete the public record.\n\nIf the allegations prove true, the House will have no choice but to act to remove this president.\n\nThe rule of law can\u2019t withstand these ongoing threats without a powerful response by our institutions of government and the public. It\u2019s time for political leaders and people of conscience, across party lines, to stand up in defense of the national interest.\n\nMore From Just Security\n\n\u201cThe Dangers of the DR-Congo\u2019s Post-Election Dispute\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cU.S. Congress Should Stop Security Assistance to Guatemala Until Rule of Law Is Restored\u201d", "stance": "L", "url": "https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/01/trump-perjury-michael-cohen-compromised-russia-mueller.html", "imageUrl": "https://compote.slate.com/images/2516dd65-58fd-4e24-bdfc-194886c925c6.jpeg?width=780&height=520&rect=2200x1467&offset=0x0", "datePublished": "2019-01-18T16:21:27Z", "dateScraped": "2019-01-19"}, {"title": "Trump Postpones Pelosi\u2019s Trip to Afghanistan in Retaliation for Her Request to Delay State of the Union", "author": "Molly Olmstead, Molly Olmstead", "source": "Slate.com", "summary": "President Trump on Thursday notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he was postponing her previously undisclosed trip to Europe and the Middle East, ostensibly because of the partial government shutdown.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nPresident Trump on Thursday notified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he was postponing her previously undisclosed trip to Europe and the Middle East, ostensibly because of the partial government shutdown. The move appeared to be in retaliation for a letter Pelosi sent to Trump on Wednesday asking him to reschedule the State of the Union address, scheduled for Jan. 29, until after the government has reopened (or to deliver his address in writing), citing the number of currently furloughed workers who would be involved in the planning and security work.\n\nTrump\u2019s letter read, \u201cDue to the Shutdown, I am sorry to inform you that your trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan has been postponed. We will reschedule this seven-day excursion when the Shutdown is over. In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial,\u201d he added, \u201cthat would certainly be your prerogative.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely Pelosi would take a commercial flight in lieu of the military transport that had been arranged. According to Politico, Pelosi\u2019s trip to Afghanistan had been kept secret because of security concerns, and she was set to leave on her trip later Thursday. While in Afghanistan, she was to meet with members of the military, as Trump did when he went to Iraq during the shutdown last month.\n\nIn a statement responding to Trump\u2019s announcement, Pelosi\u2019s office denied that she planned to travel to Egypt. A spokesman explained, \u201cThe Congressional Delegation to Afghanistan included a required stop in Brussels for pilot rest. In Brussels, the delegation was scheduled to meet with top NATO commanders, U.S. military leaders and key allies\u2014to affirm the United States\u2019 ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of the trip was to \u201cexpress appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,\u201d according to the statement.\n\nTrump has not otherwise responded to Pelosi\u2019s letter, and according to Politico, the administration believes the government could still conduct a State of the Union address during a shutdown. But it remains unclear if Pelosi would simply cancel the event herself, as it is her role as speaker to invite, or disinvite, the president to give the address. Earlier in the day, Pelosi said she requested the SOTU postponement because she and other Democrats did not want security officials to work the event without pay.\n\nIn response to Trump\u2019s statement, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer called the decision to postpone Pelosi\u2019s trip \u201ca petty move and unworthy of the president of the United States.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham took the opportunity to criticize Pelosi without supporting Trump\u2019s response: \u201cOne sophomoric response does not deserve another,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSpeaker Pelosi\u2019s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political.\u201d\n\nOther government trips will, it appears, continue as planned.

The president did not offer fresh ideas to break the current political impasse and did not declare a national emergency so that he could bypass Congress, as had been speculated.\n\nIn a string of dubious claims, Trump blamed criminal gangs and \u201cvast quantities of illegal drugs\u201d for \u201cthousands of deaths\u201d and faulted Democrats for failing to end the shutdown, now in its 18th day. He told primetime viewers: \u201cThis barrier is absolutely critical to border security.
